I like how he uses his new powers to cause such miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events'	muje tho uska new powers ka usage bahut pasand aaya jaisa usne us miraculous events ko occur kiya
I don't like how he embarrases his other co worker but at the same time the character Evan was such an ass.	muje pasand nahi hein yar kaise voh embarrasses huva apne coworker ke saath.. aur evan ka character tho bakvas hein.
Lol, very true.  It sure makes the situation crazier that it should be 	lol, sach hein. isse aur crazier ban jaatha is situation ko
I probably would have done the same if I had been in Bruce's situation. LOL'	mein bhi aise hi kartha agar mein bruce ka situation hota lol
Likewise, I kind of wish I had his powers so I could do the same lol	agar muje powers miltha tho mein bhi aise hi kartha lol
And of course, God  (Morgan Freeman) steps in to save the day and tells Bruce what he should do.	aur us morgan freeman tho god bankar bruce ka day save kiya aur usse uska kaam nikal vaaya
Seriously!  Did you know it knocked off The Matrix Reloaded from the box office during its first week?	seriously! first week mein hi box office ko knocked off kara aur Matrix reloaded
Noooo I didn't know that.  I enjoyed the first Matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be the  hit the first one was.  Saying that I can see why it knocked it out of it's place.	nahi muje nahi patha.. lekin mein first matrix ko enjoy kar raha tha lekin donon aapas mein hit kar rahe thei.. dono us place ke liye knocked out kar rahe they

Hi! The movie I want to talk to you about today is Steven Spielberg's JAWS. It has a 97% review on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 8/10 IMDB rating!	namaste! aaj main jis philm ke baare mein aapase baat karana chaahata hoon vah hai steven spielberg kee jaws
Yes, that was worth a one time watch back in the 70's!	haan, yah 70 ke dashak mein ek baar dekhane laayak tha!
So do you agree with the ratings of the movie? Many people find it to be a scary thriller, but others describe it as being too gruesome. What do you think? Do you like this kind of movie?	to kya aap philm kee reting se sahamat hain? kaee logon ko yah ek daraavana thrilar lagata hai, lekin any log ise bheeshan bataate hain. tum kya sochate ho? kya aapako is tarah kee philm pasand hai?
I found it to be to gruesome and didn't agree with the rating.  But then, I don't like violent movies.	I found it to be to gruesome  aur reting se sahamat nahin tha. lekin phir, mujhe hinsak philmen pasand nahin hain.
I hear ya. But, maybe you should give it another try! It's a classic movie full of action and suspense. Steven Spielberg never disappoints. Do you typically like Steven Spielberg movies?	main aapakee baat sunata hoon.lekin, shaayad aapako ise ek aur koshish denee chaahie! yah ekshan aur saspens se bharapoor klaasik philm hai. steven spielberg kabhee niraash nahin karate.kya aap aamataur par steevan speelabarg philmen pasand karate hain?
I'm not sure as to whether I'd like to give it another try or not,  but then again I liked ET. 	mujhe yakeen nahin hai ki kya main ise ek aur koshish dena chaahoonga ya nahin, lekin phir mujhe eetee pasand aaya.
Well, like one person put it, it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way. Since it's a classic, it might not be exactly as you remember. Might be worth the watch even if just for the laughs!	khair, jaise ek vyakti ne ise rakha, yah ek tarah se vudee elan kee tarah mazedaar hai.choonki yah ek klaasik hai, yah theek vaisa nahin ho sakata jaisa aap yaad karate hain. bhale hee sirph hansee ke lie ghadee dekhane laayak ho!
Perhaps the humor is subtle.  I recall not really seeing to much humor in it though, 	shaayad haasy sookshm hai. mujhe yaad hai ki vaastav mein isamen jyaada haasy dekhane ko nahin mila
Well, I suppose the film works for both types of people. Some love it because of its action and because it's a scary thriller, while others find it to be more humorous and funny. 	khair, mujhe lagata hai ki philm donon tarah ke logon ke lie kaam karatee hai. kuchh ko isake ekshan se pyaar hai aur kyonki yah ek daraavana thrilar hai, jabaki any ise adhik vinodee aur majaakiya samajhate hain.
That's true, and it probably also has a lot to do with the types of humor people like, or don't care for. 	yah sach hai, aur shaayad yah bhee haasy ke prakaar ke logon ke saath bahut kuchh karana hai, ya paravaah nahin hai.
Yeah, that's true. But, of course, most watch it for the thrill. For example, there is a scene in the movie where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While she's in the water, she's suddenly pulled under! It's unexpected and thrilling, one of the reasons why I enjoy this movie. 	haan voh sach hein. par jyada log us thrill ke liye dekhenge. udharan, voh movie me yek scene yek aurat uska naam chrissie watkins skinny dipping karthi thi ocean mein. jab voh pani mein hein, achanak use upper pull kar the hein, voh toh unexpected aur thrill bhi hein, muje toh us movie dekhkar badi kushi huvi.
I honestly don't know what else to say...... This has been going on way too long and is honestly silly. I'm going to return the HIT. Hopefully you can abort the conversation and still get paid. This is terrible	muje kuch patha nahi ab vaakahi mein mein kya kahun... voh toh bahut long ja raha hein , aur voh silly bhi hein. mein toh return karne vala hoon us hit ko. isse aapka conversation abort hoga magar aapko paid bhi hoga. voh terrible hein yar
Ok, let's get this done.  Nice chatting with you either way!  :-)	acha ab mein chala. aapse chat karne se muje kushi hein

Oh, how funny. Do you think that the IMDB rating is appropriate?	acha kitna funny hein, kya aapko laga ki IMDB ka rating appropriate hota hein?
I do. 8/10 seems right. The Rotten Tomatoes review seems high, but it's impressive	haan yar, 8/10 toh right hi hota. Rotten Tomatoes ka review bhi high hota muje pasand hein
I agree, Rotten Tomatoes usually has horrible ratings so it is a bit surprising. I like the main theme that people can't be judged based on their color (well in this case species).	yeh sahi baat hai ki rotten tomatoes ki ratings kharab hoti hai usually, isiliye yeh todha surprising hai. Mujhe main theme acchi kagi jaha log judge nahi kiye ja rahe apne rang k liye. ( kam se kam is case species me)
What Holiday was this released around?	kis chutti k aap pass yeh release hui tha?
Do you think Judy recording Nick was an ethical decision?	kya tumhe lagta ki judy ne Nick ko jo record kia wo ethical tha?
I don't recall the holiday. I do think that it was ethical because he was a wanted suspect so she was just doing her job.	Mujhe holiday yaad nahi. Par mujhe yeh zarur lagta ki yeh ethical tha kyuki wo ek wanted suspect tha aur wo sirf apna kaam kar rahi thi
I think the ending made up for her recording, because she realized that Nick's past being bullied had a huge effect on him.	mujhe lagta hai jo ending thi usne sab sahi kar dia kyuki usko realize hua ki Nick ki past me jo bulling hui wo uspar kaafi effect ki hai
I also thought it was super unfair of Bogo to request her resignation so quickly. She was still new to the force.	mujhe yeh bhi laga ki yeh bohot unfair tha jo bogo ne usse resignation maanga kyu wo abhi nayi thi force me
I agree with that, it was unfair. However, she got tricked by Nick on her first day I honestly don't think she was qualified for the position.	mujhe bhi yeh baat sahi lagi, wo nayi thi.  halaki, wo pehle din hi Nick se trick ho gayi, wo is position k liye qualified hi nahi thi
She was a bit naive, but she also shouldn't have been out alone as a rookie.	wo todhi pagal thi, magar use akele aise rookie par nahi jana tha
I loved Bellwethers character, I know she's a bad guy, but Jenny Slate does such a good job	mujhe Bellwethers ka character sabse mast laga, mujhe pata hai wo buri thi usme magar Jenny Slate ne bohot accha kaam kia
I have to agree with you on that. I don't see her as much of a bad guy, since she offered Nick and Judy access to the security cameras.	Mai tumse sehmat hu ispar. Mujhe wo itni buri bhi nahi lagi kyuki usne Nick aur Judy ko security camera ka access dia.
In the end when Judy asked Nick to join the Zootopia police department, do you think that was a good call on her part?	end mein jab judy ne Nick se Zootopia police department ko join karne kaha tha, toh kya aap isse ache call kahe jaayenge?
Probably not, just because he ended up liking her doesn't mean he had completely turned himself around	bilkul nahi yar, kyon ki end mein usne pyar toh kiya lekin uska pura nahi usse diya
Yeah, the movie didn't show Nick developing enough for him to be trusted with that kind of authority. Plus I am guessing that his criminal background wouldn't go well.	haan, is movie mein toh nick neh uska trust aur authority nahi develop ki. aur muje guess hein ki voh criminal background mein jarur nahi aayega
It was sweet when Nick stuck up for Judy when BOGO tried to demand her to quit	voh toh pyara tha jab nick nei judy ke liye stuckup kiya jab BOGo nei use quit karne ka demand kiya
I agree, he definitely showed some development there, possibly just gratitude.	mein maantha hoon, voh toh kuch development showed kiya, kuch gratitude bhi
Did you think that the use of drugs in the movie was a bit too much? (the creation of drugs I should say)/	kya aap ko kuch aise nahi laga ki movies mein drug ka usage kuch jaasti tha?
I think it was innocent enough. Probably too complicated of a plot line to really do any harm to kids.	muje lagtha hein ki voh innocent tha. aur kuch plot line mein add kiye honge toh voh aur complicated ban saktha aur kids ke liye toh harm ho saktha tha
They could get the jist of it, that bellwether made the wolves do bad things, but beyond that, they probably didn't relate it to drugs as we think of them	jo kiya so paayega, jab wolves ne bad things kiya lekin voh drug se relate nahi kiya, jo hum soch rahe they
I know what you mean.	muje patha hein aap kya aap bole
My young cousin asked me what they were and why he was making them what they do to people, etc. So it might not influence most children but definitely some.	mera choti cousin pucha ki voh kya hein aur kyon us loog kon hein aur bla bla. isliye mein children ko nahi influence karne devunga.

Oh no, that is awful	are vah, yeh toh bahut badiya hein
The king and queen take the younger sister to be healed, and the being that heals her also changes her memory so that she doesn't remember her older sister has magical abilities.	king aur queen apni choti beti ko heal karne le jaathe hein, magar uska heal aisa hota ki uski memory thoda change hota hein ki uska badi bahen ko magic karne ka ability use nahi patha chaltha hein

Elsa eventually becomes queen, but she's terrified that people will find out about her powers and be afraid of her.
