hello	hello
hello there, I have not seen this movie so im going to take a minute to look it over :)	hello yar, mein is movie ko nahi dekha hoon tho, tho mein thode der ke liye isko dekh loonga
Alright that is fine. What is the movie?	acha tho is movie kis baare me hein?
The movie is The Social Network	is movie tho social network ke bare mein hein
I have not seen that one either.	mein aise kuch nahi dekha hoon
It appears to be like a biographical movie about Mark Zuckerberg and when he creates Facebook.	yeh tho biographical movie ke tarah hein, mark zukerberk ke baare mein hein kya jo facebook create kiya
Ohh yes I remember hearing about that movie, but it was a long time ago it feels like.	haan yar. mein bhi is movie ke baare mein suna hoon, kahi saal ke pehle aaya tha na.
Rotten Tomatoes has rated it 96% so that's decent, and it is a movie from 2010	Rotten Tomatoes ne toh 96% deya tha aur yeh movie tho 2010 ka hein
may be worth watching!	haan worth watching hein
Yes I think it could be, although I personally do not like facebook as a company.	haan muje bhi aise hi lagtha, lekin personally muje facebook itna bhi pasand nahi hein.
the movie portrays the founding of social networking website Facebook and the resulting lawsuits. It even has Justin Timberlake in it, I don't think I've ever seen him act. 	is movie tho social networking ke baare mein portrays kiya hein yaani facebook website ke tarah. voh tho Justin Timberlake hi hey, muje nahi lagtha ki voh aise act kar saktha hein.
I have not seen him in any movies in years	mein kaafi saalon se usse kuch movies mein nahi dekha
Any other big name actors in it?	aur koi badi actors hein kya is mein?
hmm so I just got a scene described to me, it turns out Mark was dumped so he made a blog about her ... kind of childish.... then he made a site for people to "rate" women on looks...the college put him on porbation. and then that captured the attention of two classmates , that how the trio came to work on facebook I guess.	hmm, tho is scene tho mark ke baare mein hein... thoda childish hein... voh yek women ke liye is site banaya tha... dono college mein the fir classmates ban gaye aur pyar karne lage, kaise koi facebook ke liye work kar sakthe
So it came out of Mark being kind of a douche, Makes sense when I think about the company 	tho mark jaise douche ko badiya film miltha. thoda uska company ke baare mein bhi agar voh soch lethe
Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer , and Max Minghella, not famailiar with any of those, id have to look on IMBD	jesse eisenberg, andrew garfield, armie hammer aur max minghella thoda familiar nahi hein..uska id bhi kuch IMBD
I am not familiar  with any of them either	muje bhi familiar nahi laghta
another scene came up, i guess this site was just for hrvard but then they expanded to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford... sounds very elite like lol	dusra scene mein, us hrvard ke baare mein hein jo yale, columbia aur stanford se expand huva.. kaafi elite sounds kartha.. lol
Seems like it was intended for the elite, but he saw the amount of money to be made by globalizing it	haan lagtha ki elite ne intended kiya hein, lekin kaafi money kharch kiya hein
and go figure Sean Parker who co founded Napster is in on it with Mark to make Facebook, i guess he is the one who persuaded him to drop the THE  as it was called Thefacebook originally	tho sean parker ne jo napster ke liye role play kiya tha voh tho apne aap ko persuaded kara aur Facebook ka originally role banaya hein
removing the word "the" was a smart choice atleast	the word ko remove karna waise smart choice thi atleast
yeah, flows a bit better I suppose so you can say "facebook me" lol	yes, ye thoda behatar lagta hai i suppose so tum kah sako "facebook me" lol
ah new scene, talking about all the lawsuits that came against him. 	are new scence, sabhi lawsuit jo uske against aate hai uski baat karte hai.
I feel like he has always been in trouble for the way he operates then	I feel wo jis tarah se operate karta hai wo hamesha hi trouble me raha hai then
Now it is the way he markets ads by listening through the phones	now ye uska tarika tha jisme wo market me add karta hai phone par sun kar
ending sounds weird, they said it ends with him sending a friend request to his ex who dumped him.  ironic.	ending thodi weird lagi, wo kahte hai ye khatm hua uske apni ex ko friend request bhejte hue jisne ise dump kiya tha.
Im sure that was just for the hollywood effect	mai sure hu ki ye just hollywood effect tha
yeah, he is a very selfish type of person I think in reality	yes, wo bahut selfish type ka aadmi, mere hisab se reality me bhi
I agree	I agree

Yep. The only thing I really didn't think would work is having Robert JR be part of a team. He seems to be more of a lone wolf type.	Haan. Ek hi baat mujhe lagta hai work nahin karti, woh hai Robert JR ka team mein hona. Woh loan wolf type zyada lagta hai.
He is the leader of the pack. I really dont think the averages would be as popular as it is if he wasn't the leader of the team 	Woh pack ka leader hai. Main nahin samjhta avengers itne popular hote agar woh leader nahin hota team ka.

Same here. I feel as they could've done without her. Do you think she should have her own movie?	yaha bhi wahi. I feel uske begair bhi ho sakta tha. kya aap ko lagta hai uski own movie honi chahiye ?
Maybe. It would help build her character up and she wouldn't seem as flat 	shayad. usko character build  karne madad milegi aur wo flat nahi lagegi
marvel movies dont flop but i feel as if her would flop. 	marvel movies flop nahi hote lekin mujhe lagta hai uske flop honge

I have.  It's very funny. Carrey is hilarious and I love Morgan Freeman.	Maine dekhi hai, Ye bahtu funny hai. Carrey bade hilarious hai aur I love Morgan Freeman
Yes, Jim Carrey was much more hilarious back in the days.  Morgan Freeman will always be the sound of "God" to me.	Yes, Jim Carry pehle ke dino me aur jyada hilarious the. Morgan Freeman hamesha God ki tarah sound karte hai.
Would you rewatch the movie?	Kya tum ye movie rewatch karoge?
Honestly.  I love Freeman's voice.  Jennifer Anniston was also very good.  But I did feel sorry for her character.	Honestly. Mujhe Freeman's ki voice pasand hai. Jennifer Anniston bhi bahut acchi thi. But mujhe unke character ke liye khed hai.
Yes, Bruce Almighty is one of my go-to movies.	Yes, Bruce almighty meri go-to movies me se ek hai.
The cinemascore for this movie is an A.  I'm not surprised at all to hear that.  All of the actors did a fabulous job.	Is moive ka cinemascore A hai. Mujhe se sun kar koi surprise nahi hua. Sabhi actors ne fabulous kaam kiya hai.
Yes I feel sorry for her character but her character sounds too much like her Friends days.	Yes mujhe unke character ke liye khed hai par unha character bahut kuch Freinds days ki tarah tha.
I do not think I would rewatch this movie.	Hume lagta nehi ke hum dobara ye movie dekhenge

Oh??  Why not?  Do you not like comedies?	Kiu nehi? Tum ko comedies achcha nehi lagta
Rotten Tomatoes has a rotten score for it, so I think i am swayed by that.	Rotten Tomatoes ke pas ek rotten score hai iske liye. Mujhe lagta hai ke hum usise behe haye hai.
Oh but the CinemaScore is an A.	Lekin iss cinema ka score A hai
Comedies seem to be very cliche and there does not seem to be one that I have favored in awhile.	Comedies kavi kavi bahot cliche hotehe lekin humko iye kavi passand nehi hai
Well I think the actors all did a fabulous job and the three main actors are all very good actors.	Mujhe lagta he ke sabhi actor achcha acting kiya hai lekin tin main actors bahot hi achcha kiya hai
Morgan Freeman is a good in all his roles	Morgan Freeman sob roles bahot hi achcha karta hai
However, I cannot say the same for Jim Carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years	Jim Carrey ke bareme hum ye abhi kehe nehi sakte kiu ke is sal pe wo achha nehi kiya
Totally totally agree!!  Morgan Freeman is the bomb.	Hum bhi tumse pura agree kartehe ke Morgan Freeman bomb hai

Me either. He did such a good job with avengers. If he had failed their is no way they would be releasing infinity wars in may 	Main bhee unhonne Avengers ke saath itana achchha kaam kiya. yadi vah viphal ho gaya tha, to koee raasta nahin hai ki ve maaya mein infinty wars jaaree karenge
Yep. The only thing I really didn't think would work is having Robert JR be part of a team. He seems to be more of a lone wolf type.	Haan keval ek cheej jo mainne nahin socha tha ki kaam karegee, Robert jr ek teem ka hissa hoga. vah ek akela bhediya prakaar adhik prateet hota hai.
He is the leader of the pack. I really dont think the averages would be as popular as it is if he wasn't the leader of the team 	Voh pack ka neta hai  mujhe nahin lagata ki Avengers utana lokapriy hoga jitana ki vah teem ka neta nahin tha
This is true too	Yah sach bhee hai

Black widow. Her character just didn't pop for some reason	Black widow. Usko character jyada pop ni kiya for some reason.
Same here. I feel as they could've done without her. Do you think she should have her own movie?	Same here. mujhe aisa laga jaise uske bina bhi they could've done it. Tumhe lagta usse khud ki movie milegi?
Maybe. It would help build her character up and she wouldn't seem as flat 	shayd. isse uska character build hoga or wo inta flat nhi lagegi.
