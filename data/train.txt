yes batman begins i think this a great batman film have you seen it	ha batman start huwa mene socha hi ki ee batman film tho great hi aap dekha hi kya
yes i have christian bale is my favorite batman so far	ha mere pas hi christian bale tho mera favorite batman hi abhi tak
do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them	aap movies ka ratings dekega kya dekhne ke pehle
i usually do but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not	mene dekungi lekin rating se kuch farak nahi padega jho mene dekungi ya nahi
the film has several great big name actors which is another reason i like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone	ee film tho bahut great bada actors tha ee tho dusara reason hi mere kho aacha laga aur mene dekungi bina actors keliye
i agree there are quite a few great actors in batman begins i like liam neeson too even though he is one of the villains	ha bahut sara great actors hi batman begins me mene like karungi liam neeson tho bi vo tho eek villain be hi
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest along with super heros and villans a good rating does help me feel like i will not waste my time watching something awful	utna potential hi actors me dekhke big screen mere kho bahut interest aaya tha milke dono super heros aur villans bhi hi isko aacha rating help karega mene time waste mat karungi dusara awful movie dekhke
but the same time will not deter me from a film if i am just into the genre	lekin same time me mene nahi deter karungi ee film se if mene just genre dekhke
i m not sure if i agree with the metacritic score of though	waise mein sure nahi hun ki mein metacritic ke score se agree karunga
the on rotten tomatoes seems more accurate	rotten tomatoes pe zyada accurate lagta hai
i will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on dvd video if the rating turn me off	generally mere paas enough patience hota hai to wait for a film to be released on dvd video agar mujhe rating pasand nahi aati

batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out	batman as a child accha step tha by the filmmaker ye dikhane ke liye ki uski life kaise start hui
because this movie is called batman begins i agree that it was appropriate to show bruce s beginnings	because movie ka naam batman begins hai so i agree ki bruce ki shuruaati life dikhana appropriate hai
i think it s ironic that the mugger s name is joe chill but he isn t chill if he murders people	mere khyal se ye ironic hi hai ki mugger s name is joe chill lekin wo chill nahi hai if he murders people
unlikely yes i think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to the bats	unlikely haan mujhe lagta hai wo batman kaise bana k ek mysterious beginning dikhana chahte the but phir bhi thodi mystery chhodna chahte the ke use bats ka phobia kaise hota hai
very ironic mr chill is more of a bone chilling murderer	bahut ironic mr chill to ek bone chilling murdered hai
he is also murdered too so at least he gets what he deserves	uska bhi murder hojata hai to kam se kam wo jo deserve karta hai use mil jata hai
he got whats coming to him but bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge	jo uske liye hona tha usko mil jata hai but brucse uska murder nahi karta to main sochta hu wo uski badla leni ki chahat rah jaati hai
injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder in any case	injustice kabhi bhi murder ka reason nahi hona chaiye
what did you think of the scarecrow scenes	tum scarecrow wale scenes k baare me kya sochte ho
the scarecrow was particularly scary character trying to poison the water supply	scarecrow kafi scary character tha water supply ko poison karne ki try kar raha tha
and batman was poisoned with the fear inducing drugs i thought it was over for him	aur batman fear inducing drugs se poisoned tha mujhe laga uska sab over hai
he seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences	lagta hai past experience survive karne ke baad usme otherworldy power they

yeah i think joss whedon was a good choice for director also his vision was really inline with the comics	han mujhe lagta he ki director ke liye bhi joss whedon good choice uska vision comics ke sath vastav me inline tha
well i can t speak for the comics haven t read them but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories	well me comics ke regarding to kah nahi sakta me unhe read nahi kiya ke but ye movies all heroes aur unki stories ka ek great mashup ke
i guess it s just a very good movie with an amazing plot	meraguess ye he ki ye ek very good movie he amazing plot ke sath
i agree	me agree karta hu
loki using clint barton to help him with the tesseract was awesome too i like him even though he s a bad guy	loki ka clint barton ko use karna tesseract ki liye help k liye bhi awesome tha mujhe wo pasand hai even though wo bad guy hai
it was interesting how it caused such a riff within the avengers thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie	avengers me uska kaha suni karwarna kaafi interesting tha thor ko movie k doran aise lag raha tha uske liye loyalty hai
you think	tum ye sochte ho
that s just my opinion obviously	wo bas mera opinion hai obviously
do you have a specific example on mind	tumhare mind me koi specific example hai
the end fight scene definitely was he could have killed him	wo end fight scene definitely wo use maar sakta tha
oh the one where hulk ends up hitting him	oh wha kha hai jise hulk maar rha hai
yeah that was classic one of the funniest moments of the movie i also liked when iron man fell back through the wormhole it had everyone on edge i think	ha yeh classic tha film ke sabse majedar samay mai se ek muje bhi pasand aya maine wormhole ke madhyam se vapas gir gaya muje lgta hai ki yeh har kisi ke pass tha
absolutely epic scenes	bilkul mahakavya ke scenes hai
understood	samaj gya

the part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard	first movie ka end tho is part mein hein jab voh microphone mein burps out kiya tho mera kids jor se has rahe they
hahah i bet	haha
it was really a cruel thing for him to do to mike	yeh tho sach mein cruel thing hein mike keliye
it seemed a little out of character for sulley but i guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving	sulley keliye tho yeh little out character hein lekin conflict ke liye tho unke paas final source jarur hoga
for sully to trick mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful	sully ko mike ko trick karne ko soch de tho voh dar gaya kitna hurtful hein
and it explains why they re always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie they were once in that same position	aur in mein explain kiya ki kaise voh janitors ka original moives se ache hein same position mein tho hein voh

it does show a really good message for kids to be respectful of everybody	isme kids keliye ache message hein jo respectful hein sabhi keliye
it s a valuable message be kind and respectful to everyone don t expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life just be prepared to work your hardest	in mein valuable message hein sabhi ke saath kind aur respectful hona apni credentials aur family reputation ke liye kabhi life mein lean mat hona sirf prepare se ho
maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition because he didn t really realize the consequences of his actions just did what he thought was right	lekin uska background thoda spoiled hein kyon ki voh competition mein cheat kiy lekin unka action ka consequences nahi realize huva bas kya use right laga voh kar baita

you ve got a good point there about the cheating	tumhare pass bahut badhiya point hai cheating ke baare men
and you have a good point there about kids needing that message	aur aapke pass yah badhiya point hai is message ka kids ki jaruraton ke baare me

superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money though	superstar actors ka voice acting karna is always going to make money though
yes it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters	han ye ek as a whole series pe refreshing outlook tha aur characters ke liye nice background provide karti hai
i agree i liked when they show mike s background story of why he became a scarer i always wondered why he chose to do that	i agree mujhe acha laga jab unhone mike ki background story dikhayi ki wo scarer kyun ban gaya main hamesha sochta hu usne aisa karna kyun chose kia
true and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed	sach aur ye ye dikhane ka acha kaam karti hai ki dono characters flawed hain
i thought the whole scare games plot was a fairly good one too kept it interesting	mery khyal k mutabiq tamam khofnak game ka plot kafi achaa bhi tha bht dilchasp rakha
i agree i like that they didn t try to make them perfect	mai manta hun mjhy acha laga k unhun ne unko oerfect banany ki koshish nai ki
yes and so much was at stake for them in that game as well	han aur unky lia bht kuch us game mai dao per bhi laga hua tha
i thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment	mery mutabiq ye anhooni ko sirf delay ker rha tha aur unhy accomplishment ki aik jhooti tasalli de rha tha
i agree i felt bad for mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win	mai manta hun mjhy mike k lia bura laga jo soch rha tha k wo khud se kamyaab hua jabky usy jeetny mai madad di gaye
i thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team was diqualified for cheating	mery khyal tha k ye ironic bhi hai qk unhy phly muqabbly mai sirf is lia nikala gaya q k dusri team ko cheating kerny per disqualify kia gaya
yes i agree it ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well	han ge mai manta hun iska khatma unhy university se nikalny per he hua
i feel like they sacrificed themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted though	mjhy lagta ha k unhun ne baki tamam logon k accept hony ki waja se apni qurbani di hai
i agree and i think that it was a noble thing to do at least they still were able to be hired at monsters inc and work their way up to becoming scarers	mai manta hun aur mera khyal hai k ik acha kaam tha krny ko kam az kam wo monsters inc mai hire hony k qabil thy aur apny apko scarer banany tak phncha skty thy
yeah guess it shows that you don t need education sometime haha	han guess ye dikhata hai ki sometimes tumhe education nahi chahiye haha
exactly sometimes all that s needed is preservation and hardwork	exactly kabhi kabhi sirf preservation aur hardwork hi needed hota hai
at least they didn t get in a lot of trouble with the cda	kam se kam ye cda ke saath zyada trouble mein nahi pade
yeah i was taken aback when hardscrabble said they were the first students to surprise her	han i was taken aback jab hardscrabble ne bola wo usey surprise karne wale first students they

occasionally i also enjoyed the development of sebastian and mia s relationship such as when mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because sebastian suggests it to her i feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship	kabhi kabhi mujhe bhi sebastian aur mia ki relationship ka development achha laga jaise jab mia decide karti hai ki ab wo akele hi play karegi kyuki sebastian ne usko aisa suggest kia mujhe laga ki wo dono bohat grow karte hain as individuals jab wo relationship mein aa jate hain
i enjoyed that part too since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams	maine woh part bhi enjoy kiya kyon ki yeh dikhata hai kitna hard ye donon kaam kar rahen hain apne dreams achieve karne ke liye
they both want to become successful in their separate areas but they have to struggle a lot	donon chahte hain ki successful banen apne seperate ares mein lekin bahut struggle karna padega
right i feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that s involved in following your dreams really sums it up the film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big	right lagta hai review jo cruelty ko mention karta hai dreams ko follow karten hai sum karta hai film afraid nahin karta hai ki kitna hard work aur hardship involve karta hai bada hasil karne ke liye
i mean he gets paid but it s not something he wants to do this happens in life a lot	mera matlab hai use payment milta hai lekin woh hai nahin karna chahta hai ye bahut hota hai life mein
it was definitely well acted and i sympathize with both of them	usme ekdum acchi acting thi lekin sympathize karta hoon donon se
it truly was heartbreaking when mia moved back home to nevada	truly woh heartbreaking thi jab mia vapas nevada ghar mein gayi
it really was sad	voh toh bura huva
if so i was completely fooled	agar aisa hai to mujhe poori tarah se fool bnaya gaya
but i really was surprised that someone reviewed sebastian as a jazz snob because i did not get that vibe at all	lakin main bilkul surprise hu ki kisi ne sebastian ko as a jazz snob reviewed kiya kyun ki mujhe wo vibe bilkul bhi nahi mili
he is a purist or whatever they called it in the film	wo ek purist hai ya phir jo kuch bhi unhone use film main bulaya
i also really didn t think mia s character lacked depth i think she was a rather round character especially with the large amount of independence she possessed it took a lot of courage for her to move back to nevada	mujuhe bhi aisa nahi lagta ki mia ka character depth main lack karta hai mujhe lagta hai balki wo round character thi especially usne large amount of independence ke sath usne possessed kiya use bahut zada courage lagi hogi wapas neveda ke main wapas jane ke liye
yes i thought her character was pretty nuanced but i m not sure it being courageous of her to move back to nevada after the play didn t go well i think that was her only option	hann mujhe lagta hai ki uska character pretty nuanced tha lakin main sure nahi hu ki ye uke liye courageous hai wapas nevada move hona play ke sahi na jane ke baad mujhe lagta hai uske paas keval yahi option tha
about it	iske bare main
although i wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams	halaki main wish karta hu ki vain apne dreams ko achieve karne se pehle reconcile kare
the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad	end me jo dikhaya ki actually me kya ban sakta hai usse maine kafi sad feel kiya
i agree it was very sad but also as one reviewer puts it quite bittersweet i wasn t sure how to feel at the end	i agree yah bahut sad tha but also ek reviewer ne jaise bataya ki yah quite bittersweet ha mai sure hi nahi tha ki ant me mai kya feel karu
it was nice discussing the film with you have a great day	aapke sath film discuss karke achcha laga hava a great day
you guys have a pretty good ai system	aap logon ke pass ek badhiya ai system hai
i was actually completely fooled	completely fool ban gaya tha actually me
hi	hi
hi it told me to read this page first so i ll be just a minute	hi muje pehla page ko read karne keliye kahi gaya toh aap yek minute dhoda wait kareye
okay done reading is anyone there	acha khadam hogaya ki aur hein kya
welp i hope i still get paid for this because i read the directions read the movie description and am waiting here to chat i was directed to do	acha muje lagtha hein ki iske liye muje paid hoga kyon ki mein directions aur movie ka description read kiya aur mein usko chat karne ke liye wait kiya
other participant left the conversation early	dusri participant toh pehle hi left ho gaye
hello	hello
hello	hello
i just watched batman vs superman have you seen it yet	maine abhi batman vs superman dekhi aapne dekhi hai abhi tak
no i haven t	no maine nahi dekhi
it s the first movie like this with batman and superman together	yeh batman aur superman ki sathme aisi pehli movie hai
that sounds good	sunkar achha laga
batman is played by ben affleck he gets tricked into fighting superman	batman ka role ben affleck ne nibhaya hai use superman ke sathme ladai karne ka trick milka hai
who plays superman	superman ka role kisne nibhata hai
henry cavill wonder wo man is in it too	henry cavill wonder kaun sath me hoga
i m not sure of her name b ut laurence fishburne and holly hunter are in it too	mai uske nam par sure nahi hu lekin sayad laurence fishburne aur holly hunter ho sakta hai
i like both of them the movie sounds good how long is it	mai un dono ko pasand karta hu movie ki sound achi hai aur kitna der
it didn t get very good critics scores	ishe bahut acha critic score nahi mile
that is a long movie i enjoy long movies especially in the theaters it sounds interesting what did the critics have to say about it	yah yek lambi moive hai muje lambi moive pasand hai khaskar theater me iski sounds majedar hai kritic ne iske bare me kya kaha
cinemascore graded it as a b rotten tomatoes and metacritic score was one of the critics said it wasn t as good as dark knight but it was better than man of stee	cinema score ne ishe b grad diya rotten tomatoes ne aur metacritic ne yek critic ne khayah ki ye dark night jaisi achi nahi par man of steel se achi hai
steel	istel
wow those are really low scores i am surprised at that usually these types of movies are popular and do well	wah ye to vastav me kam score hai vaise jayadatar eshi moives popular hoti hai aur acha pradsan karti hai
yeah agreed in one part of the movie superman s mom gets kidnapped and the kidnapper demands he kill batman for his mom s release	ha mai manta hu moive ke yek hisse maisuperman ki mom kidnap huyi aur kidnaper ne kaha ki vo uski maa ke badle batman ko marega
and what happens once his mom is released	aur phir uski mom release hone k baad kya hoga
she isn t released that way because batman realizes right before he kills superman that they are both being tricked batman ends up rescuing superman s mom and superman goes after the kidnapper	wo waise release nahi hoti hai kyuki batman superman ko maarne se theek pahle samjh jata hai k dono ko trick kiya gaya hai batman superman ki mom ko bachata hai aur superman kidnapper k peeche jata hai
and who wins	kaun jeetta hai
that sounds exciting is wonder woman in the movie a lot	kaafi exciting sound karta hai kya is movie me wonder woman kaafi hai
luthor gets arrested and then batman goes to visit him in prison i don t want to tell you the outcome of the fight because i don t want to ruin the ending no wonder woman doesn t have a very big part	luthor arrest hojata hai phir batman usse visit karne jail me jata hai main tumhe fight ka outcome nahi batana chahta kyuki main ending ruin nahi karna chahta no wonder woman ka bahut bada part nahi hai
there may have been a movie coming out the same weekend they were friends with the director or something loke that	ho sakata hai usee veekend koee philm aa rahee ho jisamen ve nirdeshak se dostee kar rahe the ya kuchh aisa kar rahe the

hello	hello
hi	hi
so the movie we re talking about is inception	so ham jis movie ke bare me baat kar rahe hai wo inception hai
have you seen it	tumne dekhi hai kya
what is the movie about i haven t seen it	yah movie kis bare me hai maine dekhi nahi hai
yeah i ve seen it it s directed by christopher nolan if you ve heard of him	yeah maine dekhi hai ise christopher nolan ne direct kiya hai agar tumne unke bare me suna ho
inception also has a rotten tomatoes score of which is really high	inception ka bhi rotten tomatoes par score hai jo ki kafi high hai
leonardo dicaprio is in it along with joseph gordon levitt ellen page and tom hardy all pretty big names	leonardo dicaprio bhi isme hai with joseph gordon levitt ellen page aur tom hardy ke saath sabhi kafi bade naam hai
yeah pretty good actors	yeah kafi acche actors
what about the other movie ratings	doosara movie rating ke bare me kya rai hai
imdb rates it	imdb rating me aatha hai
which is also pretty high i think	woh bahut achha hai mujhe eisa lagtha hai
do you want to know more of the plot or a scene	aap kiske bare me jan na chahthe ho plot or drshya
yeah it seems like a high rating what was your favorite scene	lagtha hai is ka rating achha high aap ka pasandeeda drshya kaun si hai
so there s this scene where multiple people are going into a dream so they need to have someone kick them awake at the same time to escape however someone gets wounded in the dream and are almost dying and they get sent into limbo	scene me bahut sare aadmi swapn me kho jaath hai koi unko jagane aur bachane ki zaroorat hai par koi log swapn me ghaayal ho gaye aur marnevale the aur limbo ho jaathe hai
they basically are stuck there until someone can wake them up in the real world so in the movie even though it was only a few hours of real time two of the characters spent fifty years in the limbo world where they had to construct it based on their shared memories	woh fass jaathe hai jab tak unhe koi nai jaga tha aur duniya me le aatha is movie me bale asli duniya kuch ghante ke liye hai par do character pachas saal limbo duniya me tha gayee yaadon par banan pada
and whats the role of leonardo di caprio in this film	leonardo di caprio ka is film me kya role hai
one more thing about the limbo world is that eventually people forget that the world they are in is not real	limbo world ke baare mein ek aur cheez hai ki eventually log bhool jaate hain ki jis duniye mein wo hain wo real nahi hai
so they can t distinguish between a dream and what is real	to wo dream aur real ke beech mein distinguish nahi kar sakte
even when they wake up in a dream they are still in the dream even if they don t realize it	even agar woh dream mein wake up bhi ho jaate hain to bhi wo dream mein hi hote hain even if they don t realize it
seems like a really interesting concept	really interesting concept lagta hai
so far the plot seems great and the cast seems pretty good as well	ab tak to plot seems great aur cast bhi kaafi acchi lag rahi hai
also the director	director bhi
yeah it s a pretty quality movie	yeah woh kaafi acchi quality ki movie hai
i can tell you more about the plot if you want	agar tum chaho to mein plot ke baare mein aur bata sakta hun
yeah that would be great	woh great hoga

so there are things called totems	to totem nam ka cheesen hote hai
they basically are an object that reminds someone that they are dreaming	yeh basically ek object hota hai jo jis ka sapna dekh rahe hai us ko remind karta hai
something that roots them to the real world	aisa cheez jo real world mein le jaye
interesting i think i will give the movie a chance and watch it it seems worth my while	yeh to interesting hai mujhe lagta hai ki mein ye movie dekhoonga yeh mere time ke liye worth hai

not at all id give the movie a its something i was raised on lol my mom used to put it on to shut me up	bilkul nahi main movie ko dunga main isey dekh kar bada hua hu lol meri mom mujhe ye chalakar mujhe shut up karti thi
the document says its not realistic bc kevin would need tons of money to set those traps i think thats bs his family does have money lollolol everything he used he had laying around his parents giant house	document kehta hai ye realistic nahi kyunki kevin ko kafi money chahiye traps set karne ke liye mujhe lagta hai ye bs hai uski family ke paas paisa hau lollolol jo bhi usne use kia wo uske parents ke giant house mein pada tha
right i did not agree that they were traps that any year old could come up with not at all in my opinion	han main agree nahi karta ki wo traps saal ka bacha bana sakta hai mere opinion mein bilkul nahi
thats true i dont think an year old would come up with those but i dont think he would have needed his own money either i think xmas was perfect they were traveling for the holidays i prefer the other one tho where hes stuck in nyc	sach yar muje nahi lagtha ki saal bacha is tarah ka soch lekhe aayega jarur usse money ka jaruri hoga ya usse xmas ka holidays ache tarah travel karna chatha hoga
home alone is a film i was born in lol now i feel old	home alone tho ka film hein mein jab born huvi thi lol ab muje old ke tarah feel hota hein

lol you leeeeft me	lol aap tho aise hi chod diya
it sounds like a good movie it sounds like it is a good monsters inc successor	acha movie ke tarah sound kartha successor ke liye tho ache monsters sound kartha
do you typically watch movies like monster s university	tho aap typically monster university movie ke tarah dekhte hein
typically no since i generally like to watch anime but if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid then i usually will make a effort to see it	typically nahi yar kyon ki muje anime ko dekhna pasand hein jab mein kid tha jab franchise kar letha baaki tho mein effort kartha usse dekhne pe
makes sense i typically only pay attention to the ratings when it s a director who i am familiar with if i know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings i usually will wait to hear from friends family before paying to see it	make sence mein typically ratings par attention kartha koun director familiar aisa lekin agar mein phenomenal ka work dekhe tho particular movie tho awful rating hei mein usually family aur friends ke review suntha hoon
comedy movies are always a must see in my book	comedy movies tho hum book mein hi dekhte
and if im being honest pixar usually makes good movies so i have good expectations illumination movies is what im iffy about	agar mein honest hoon tho pixar ko ache movies ko ache hi keheta aur muje unme ache expectations hein illumination movies tho iffy hote
mike is what in the i never knew that	mike ka itna bhi kya hein mein kabhi suna nahi
he s only seven when he goes on the field trip he goes to college eleven years later so he d be eighteen	voh saal ke hein jab voh field trip kar raha tha voh years ka baad college gaya tho ke hei ab

every movie with a fraternity sorority always contains kappa ever notice that	kappa ko saari movies mein fraternity sorority hein kya aap notice nahi kiya
wonder what cda stands for in this movie clearly it s some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have	cda tho is movie ke liye stand kiye hein clearly is tarah form tho enforcer hein kis tarah ka enforcer is monster mein hein
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough	kuch scary tarah ho sakthe hein
nope i thought the same i think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph	nahi muje bhi aise laga kyon ki inme gender context tho nahihein
well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids	kids keliye tho yeh safe movie sound kartha
no i don t think it s to make sure they re scary enough the cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university	nahi muje nahi lagtha ki yeh itna bhi scary hein voh cda tho campus se nikhalne vaale the kyon ki university ka expulsion ho raha tha
although i expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there	although mein tho expect kar rahi thi ki koi hidden adult jokes jo college mein hota tha aur fraternity tho muje yek ya do slip karne ke liye think karaya
ah i see that would make sense	ah ab kuch sense huva
true movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them	sach aaj kal ka movies tho formulaic tropes aur kids ke pickup se he banate
i hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable	i hope ki movie fresh se stays karthe aur thoda unpredictable bhi hein
keep the kids on their toes	kids ko apne toes ke saath hi rakhna chahiye
one can only hope	yek tho jarur hope rahega
and still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it	aur still parents tho smart enough hein enjoy karne se
a on a kids movie doesn t seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes	mera opinion se kids movie tho itna bad nahi rahatha us key scenes ke read karne ke baath
thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good and still seem better than movies today	isliye past pixar film mera opinion se ache hein still aajkal ka movies se better hein
thats true i think overall it sounds like a good movie	voh tho hein overall muje ache movie sound kartha
hey what did you think of the movie	hey tum movie ke baare me kya sochte ho
yeah very cool i loved it but i like con man films in general leonardo dicaprio was great	yeh very cool mujhe ye pasand hai par mujhe in general con man pasand hai leonardo dicaprio mahan the
the acting leo hanks walkin was great	the acting leo hanks walkin mahan the
yeah i thought dicaprio was great but i think tom hanks made the movie super good	yeah mujhe lagta hai ki dicaprio mahan the but mujhe lagta hai ki tom hanks ne movie ko super good bana diya
yeah and your true story point is good i wonder what the real frank abagnale is like	yeah aur aapka true story wala point accha tha mujhe aashcharya ki real frank abagnale kaise the

to think the guy was only years old when he started	jab vo saal ka tha tab shuru huva
hey the guy was convincing enough to get a job with american world airways	are yeh guy tho american world airways ka job ko hi convince kar raha hein
probably helps that he was young you re braver and more confident at that age	probably yeh tho young hein aap tho braver aur jyada confident hon in age mein bhi
he was also young when he went to prison	voh tho young hein lekin voh prison mein hein
it is really great that the fbi hired him as a investigator years later	acha huva ki fbi ne usse hired kiya aur usse investigator banaya
the twist of ending up working for the fbi is great reminds me of jfk s dad he made a fortune insider trading it was not illegal at the time and then fdr made him the first commisioner of the sec where he was great at busting insider traders	movie me end me uska fbi k liye kaam karne wala twist badhiya hai mujhe jfk ke dad ki yaad dilata hai usne insider trading karke bahut paisa kamaya tab wo illegal nahi tha aur phir fdr ne us sec ka pahla commisioner bana diya jaha wo insider traders pakadne me maahir tha
everyone s a sucker for redemption flicks this film must have made a fortune	har kisi ko redemption flick acchi lagti hai is movie ne bahut paisa kamaya hoga

the all star cast really helped too	all star cast ne bhi help ki hai
well all depends on the movie	achchhee tarah se sabhee philm par nirbhar karata hai
this movie also may have done the best job out there on getting the hulk right	ho sakata hai ki is philm ne bhee halk ko sahee kaam karane mein behatar kaam kiya ho
it also does a nice job of making iron man a leader	yah lohe ke aadamee ko neta banaane ka achchha kaam bhee karata hai

disney does a impressive job with animated movies	animated movies ke saath disney ka job bahut impressive hai

jonathan gross as kristoff was my favorite character	jonathan gross ka kristoff ka character mera favorite hai
how about yours	tumhare bare me kya
even though he didn t have a voice i liked sven i love how disney always puts in non talking characters in their films that help move the story along	even thoough sven ki voice nahi thi par mujhe pasand hai mujhe achcha lagta hai disney kaise bina voice ke character ko film me lekar bhi kahani move karta hai
thats about as much talent as i have when it comes to art as well haha	mere paas jitanee pratibha hai utanee hee kala ke baare mein bhee hai
my kids laugh at me all the time about it	mere bachche mere baare mein har samay hansate rahate hain
hello are you there	namaste kya aap vahaan hain
yep still here	abhee bhee yahaan haan
usually sequels can be disappointing but that doesn t seem to be the case with animated movies	aamataur par seekval niraashaajanak ho sakate hain lekin yah enimeted philmon ke maamale mein nahin lagata hai
it is interesting that disney was able to add onto the history of works such as beauty and the beast	yah dilachasp hai ki dijnee saundary aur jaanavar jaise kaaryon ke itihaas mein jodane mein saksham tha
hello	hello
hello	hello
yes it is a funny animation film	jee haan yah ek phanee enimeshan philm hai
the critical response was pretty good i see	aalochanaatmak pratikriya mujhe bahut achchhee lagee
i heard they are making a second movie to follow frozen	mainne suna ki ve phrojan pholo karane ke lie doosaree philm bana rahe hain
it only got an percent on rotten tomatoes i thought it would get a higher score	sade hue tamaataron par ise keval pratishat mila mainne socha tha ki yah ek uchch ank praapt karega
it seems like this movie just came out i can not believe it was when it arrived in theaters	lagtha hein ki abhi hi us movie ko release huva muje yakin hi nahi hota ki voh mein aaya hoga jab theaters mein
who is your favorite character in frozen	frozen mein aapka favorite character kon hein
kristoff	kristoff
do you know who kristen bell is	aapko kristen bell patha nahi hein kya
i know of her but not familiar of her other acting jobs	patha hein lekin jyada familiar nahi hein jaise other acting jobs ke swar
yeah something was up when they fell for each other early in the movie between him and anna	yeah uske aur anna ke bich movie se pehle kuch hua
olaf could be a bit much sometimes but had some funny parts	olaf thoda aur hona chahiye par thoda funny part bhi
yeah i did not even guess he would have been a bad guy	yeah mene socha nahi tha wo bad ladka hoga
i think i called it during the movie and said something to my fiance about how redheads are always portrayed as badguys	mene socha mene use movie ke dauran bulaya and finance ke bare me kuch kaha kaise redheads are always portrayes as badguys
good point i didn t even think of that	achha point mene socha bhi nahi tha
he looks like the villian commander from the newer star wars movies	naye star wars movie me wo villian commander ke jesa dikh raha tha
what rating would you give the movie out of ten	das me se kitne rating donge movie ko
i think an it was a great movie even if the music is overplayed	nine accha movie tha music jyada play hone ke bad bhi
bye	aavjo
what is your opinion on the movie jaws	philm joz par aapakee kya raay hai
to be honest i find shark movies to be terrifying	sach kahoon to mujhe shaark philmen bhayaanak lagatee hain
no i didn t not surprised though most movies tend to be	nahi maine nahi lekin mein surprise nahi hun zyadatar movies mein aisa hi hota hai
i do love the jaws music though	lekin jaws ka music mujhe pasand hai
agreed it heightens the tension and makes it scarier but that s kind of the point	agreed ye tension ko badhata hai aur isko aur daravana banata hai lekin shayad uska wahi point hai
is incredibly high i would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores in there somewhere	bahut zyada high hai mujhe laga ki kam se kam kuch log to low scores denge
for small children yes i could see them having nightmares	chhote bacchon ke liye haan unko nightmares aa sakte hain
in today s society i think that would absolutely be the case even if there was a bounty hunter hired they would probably go nothing to see here have fun	aaj ke society mein mujhe lagata hai ki aisa hee hoga yahaan tak ​​ki agar ek bounty hunter ko kaam par rakha gaya tha to ve shaayad bolengain yahaan dekhane ke lie kuchh bhee nahin hai maze karo
or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the money	ya aapako lagata hai ki tourists paisa banaane ke lie bounty mein shaamil honge
the key scens describes both a tiger shark and a great white	key scenes main tiger shark aur ek great white donon ka varnan kiya gaya hai
i always think of great white s as the huge jaws sharks	maine great whites ko humesha unn badi jaws sharks ki tarah socha hai
it seems odd that they don t ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene	ajeeb hai ki woh kissi scientist ya marine biologist ko beech mein nahi laa rahe
even the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to hook the shark or harpoon it	last scene mein bhi bohot hi limited plan hai shark ko hook ya harpoon karne ka
i agree they have an oceanographer to help determine a shark attack but no scientists ever get brought in to help the situation	sahi i agree unke paas shark attack determine karne ke liye ek oceanographer hai par koi scientists nahi laaye help karne ke liye
it seems like a pretty poor plan and they end up having to make it up as they go along	kaafi bekar plan hai aur aage jaate jaate woh plan banaate jaa rahe hain
it seems crazy that a shark could take out a shark proof cage	kitna crazy hai ki shark ne shark proof cage todd diya
plus the reward of only seems pretty low to risk lives	aur ka reward bohot kam hai life risk karne ke liye
maybe it was worth a lot more in	shayad mein isse zyaada worth tha
and it was definitely worth more in i just don t know how much	aur yeh definitely adhik kimat ka hoga me nahi janti how much
what did you think of gal gadots portrayal of wonder woman	wonder woman mei gal gadots portrayal ke bare mei kya khayal hai
i thought she did a great job	mere khayal se usne bahut achcha kaam kiya
what did you think	tumhara kya khayal hai
i agree loved it	mei sahmat hui payaar se
me too	mei bhi
so what else did you like	to aapako aur kya pasand aaya
steve buscemi is in this too	steve buscemi bhi isme hai
yes he is i m guessing you ve seen monsters university	haa vo hai mene shoch ki tumne monsters university dekha hai
i did when it came out years ago just never thought to look at the voice acting	mene kiya jab ye kuch saal pahale aa gai thi mene nahi socha tha ki voice acting hogi
when did you see it	tumne kab dekha
hello how are	hello kaise he
you doing	aap kar rahe hai
hi i m doing well thanks	hi main accha kar raha hun thanks
so what did you think of the blind side	so aapne blind side ke baare me kya socha
same here it is a little odd that it got lower reviews on other platforms like metacritic i take it you like sports docs too	same here ye little odd hai ki ise dusre platforms par lower reviews mile jaise ki metacritic main apko sports docs ki tarah leta hun
yes very much it s surprising how much adversity oher had to overcome don t you think	yes bahut had tak main surprise hun ki kitne adversity oher ko kam karni padegi aapko nahi lagta
yeah it must ve been really difficult on him i wonder how he felt having to relive his experience through the movie i don t know how i would handle it	yeah ye nischit hi unhe liye kafi difficult hoga i wonder kaise unhone is movie ke dwara apne experience ko relive karna mahsoos kiya hoga main nahi jaanta ki main ise kaise handle karuga
yeah bullock was great although she s a great actor so i think she does well in most of her roles	hann bullock great thi waise bhi woh great actor hai and zyadatar roles mein achcha hi karti hai
any thoughts on any of the other actors i had forgotten tim mcgraw was in the movie haha	doosre actors ke baare mein kya thoughts hain main bhook gaya tha ki tim mcgraw bhi movie mein tha haha
it must have been tough to go through foster care so much but i think it s good that oher found something to latch on to in football	foster care se guzarna bahut mushkil hua hoga par achchi baat hai football mein oher ko naya sahara mila
definitely he was also very lucky to finally find a good foster family it s super difficult to find a good family that cares about their foster kids	bilkul woh bahut lucky tha ki use achcha foster family mil gayi ek achche family ka milna bahut mushkil hai jo apne foster kids ka care karti hai
what do you think of the idea of protective instincts and how it influenced oher s behavior	tumhe protective instincts idea kaise lagta hai aur is idea ne oher ke behavior ko kaise influence kiya
how did you feel about the scene where collins adopts oher	tumhe woh scene kaise laga jahan collins oher ko adopt karta hai
how did you feel about the scene where collins adopts oher	tumhe woh scene kaise laga jahan collins oher ko adopt karta hai
probably not because she was a drug addict i think he was referring to his adopted family	nahin ho sakta kyonki woh ek drug addict thi mujhe lagta hai woh apni adopted family ke baare mein bata raha tha
how do you think the gang leader in his old town affected him	tumhe kya lagta hai ki uske old town ke gang leader ka uspar kya asar hua
absolutely i think he felt more of a connection with his adoptive family than with his own	absolutely mujhe lagta hai uska apni khudki family se jyada adoptive family se connection hai
definitely and who wouldn t i don t understand why people are so connected to their blood relatives if they weren t around to be part of their family	definitely kiska nahi hoga mujhe ye nahi samjh me aata log apne blood relative se itna connected kyu rahte hai bhale he wo family ka part banne k liye paas me nahi the
good conversation thanks for chatting	accha conversation chat karne k liye thanks
hi	hi
hello	hello

hello	hello namaste
hi have you seen the john wick movies	namaskar kya tumne john wick movies watch ki
i have seen the first one but i have not seen the second one	mene first one dekhi but mene second one nahi dekhi
the next one is great where he goes after his car that was stolen	next one great he jahan voh apni stolen car ko search karne jata he
he was seeking revenge for the theft of his car and the killing of his puppy	voh toh apni car ka chori ko revenge karte karte usne puppy ko maar daali
what person was he seeking revenge against	konsa person ko voh revenge lena chatha hein
losef the son of the head of the tarasov syndicate took the mustang to aurello s shop to get the vin number changed and aurello kicks him out of the shop and tells john	losef us tarasov ka head tha usne mustant ko aurello ka shop vin number change karne ko le chala aur aurello john ko kick maara
how did john go about getting his revenge	kaise john ko patha chala ki koi use revenge lena chatha hein
john wanted to retire but was drawn back in to get revenge	john toh retire hona chatha tha lakin usse revenge ho gaya
john visited aurello who tells him losef is the son of viggo	john aurello se mila aur losef ke baare mein bathaya
who is viggo	viggo kon hein
john learns that losef is at the night club from winston of the continental he prepares to get losef he is the son of viggo who is the head of the russian syndicate in new york	john sikha ki losef yek night club mein hein aur voh use pakadna chatha hein voh viggo ka betha hein jo russian syndicate newyork mein hein uska head hein
why doesn t viggo just give losef to john	kyon viggo john ko losef ko nahi deya
john travels to little russia where viggo has a church front he destroys the cache of money and blackmail making material	john little russia jaata hai jahan viggo ke paas church front hai wahan par wo money ka cache aur blackmail banane wala samaan destroy kar deta hai
losef is his son and does not want jon to kill him	losef uska son hau aur wo nahi chahta jon usey maare
why doesn t viggo just pay for john s new car and buy him a new dog to save his son	viggo ne john ki new car ke liye kyun pay nahi kia aur usey apne bete ko save karne ke liye naya dog kyun nahi buy kia
they tried to kill john so he was after the whole sindicate and raced to the helicopter that viggo was trying to escape in	unhone john ko maarne ki try ki so wo whole syndicate ke peeche tha aur jis helicopter mein viggo escape karne ki try kar raha tha uski taraf bhaaga
i think this is the one you saw	i think ye wala tumne dekha
the part where he walks home along the boardwalk with the puppy and rembers that is where he had his last date with helen	wo part jab wo ghar walk karta hau along boardwalk puppy ke saath aur yaad karta hai ki helen ke saath uski last date yahan thi

yes this is a christmas classic and deserves an a rating i feel the critic that described the movie as having an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be	yes yah ek christmas classic hai aur a rating ke layak hai mujhe lagta hai ki jo critics is movie ko iske implausible plot ke liye criticize karte hai woh is movie ko kuchh jyada hi seriously le rahe hai creators ka irada serious movie banane ka nahi tha
very well said some of the critics were out of their minds especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half flat and unsurprising	sahi kaha kuchh critics pagal ho gaye hain khash kar woh jiska apne description diya aur woh jisne first half ko flat aur unsurprising bataya
yes i found the first half very entertaining i haven t seen this movie in a little wow i might go back and watch it	han muje first half bada entertaining laga maine ye movie little wow me nahi dekhi main shayad jaunga aur dekhunga

i know i think this was one of speilbergs best films	i know mere vichar se ye speilbergs ki best films me se ek he
most definitely	bilkul definitely
i love all of them so i can t say that i have a favorite	me un sab ko love karti hu isliye me kisi ek ko apna favorite nahi kah sakti
i m not sure if he didn t he sure deserved it	me sure nahi hoon agar usne nahi jeeta to voh sure deserve karta he
agreed i still like watching it when its on tv i ve been known to download it for a long flight too the cast was outstanding and the music still gets me creeped out	maana main abhee bhee ise dekhana pasand karata hoon jab teevee par isakee mujhe ise lambee udaan ke lie bhee daunalod karane ke lie jaana jaata hai kaast bakaaya tha aur sangeet abhee bhee mujhe baahar nikaal diya jaata hai
i saw that the critics found it funny in a weird sort of way i think i kind of agree with that comment there are moments that are funny i can t say i agree with your wife but it did scare some people too much maybe it scares her and thats why she hates it	mainne dekha ki aalochakon ko yah ajeeb tarah se ajeeb laga mujhe lagata hai ki main us tippanee se sahamat hoon aise kshan hain jo majaakiya hain main yah nahin kah sakata ki main aapakee patnee se sahamat hoon lekin isane kuchh logon ko bahut dara diya ho sakata hai ki vah use daraatee hai aur usase napharat karatee hai
i kind of enjoyed the scary moments in it	mainne isamen daraavane palon ka aanand liya
it s so realistic and it could happen	yah bahut yathaarthavaadee hai aur aisa ho sakata hai
it does happen more than you think	yah aapake vichaar se adhik hota hai
it has happened thats whats so scary several attacks likek that off the east coast last summer felt like i was living jaws i stayed off the beach last summer	ho chuka hai kya itana daraavana hai pichhalee garmiyon mein poorvee tat se door jaise kaee hamale hue the main pichhalee garmiyon mein samudr tat se door raha
so did i it freaked me out too much	to kya mainne isane mujhe bahut adhik prabhaavit kiya
in the film the found a tiger shark so they thought the beach was safe kind of like when we see a dolphin fin scream and then realize it was ok the next day they see a great white in the same area of the beach jaws for real	philm mein ek baagh shaark paaya gaya tha taaki unhen laga ki samudr tat surakshit hai ek tarah se jab ham dolphin phin dekhate hain chillaate hain aur tab mahasoos hota hai ki yah theek hai agale din ve samudr tat ke ek hee kshetr mein ek mahaan saphed dekhate hain asalee ke lie jabade
k or not i would not get in that water or that boat if a great white were out there	k ya nahin main us paanee ya us naav mein nahin jaata agar ek mahaan saphed vahaan se baahar hota
no way i wouldn t either	koee raasta nahin main bhee nahin hoga
nope not at all	nahin bilkul nahin
sounds like you re pretty clever ironic they named the boat the orca in the movie those orcas are supposed to be pretty safe	lagata hai ki tum bahut chaalaak ho vidambana hai ki unhonne philm mein naav ka naam orka rakha hai un orchas bahut surakshit maana jaata hai
and can you imagine what it was like getting in a shark proof cage i know someone who did that once they said they d never do it again	aur kya aap kalpana kar sakate hain ki shaark prooph kej mein aisa kya tha main kisee aise vyakti ko jaanata hoon jisane ek baar aisa kiya tha unhonne kaha ki ve ise phir kabhee nahin karenge
no way i would have a heart attack	bilkul nahin mujhe dil ka daura padega
well at least jaws had a happy ending not for the shark though the good old days when they made you feel good before you left the movie	jaws film me khush anth hua lekin shark ke liye nahi pahle dino jaise hame movie dekar nikalne se pahle acha lagtha hai
hi	hi

interesting scarecrow is even in the film that seems like a lot of plot if they have multiple villans in the film	film mein scarecrow bhi bahut dilchasap hai tab kafi saare plot lagte hai agr film mein bahut saare villans ho to
how was the story in your opinion	apki raay se story kaisi thi
it does not crowd the film in my opinion unlike how it turned out with batman and robin	mere raay se yeh film ko bhara hua nhi dikhate iske vipreet yeh batman aur robin ke saath kaise hua
you can have multiple villians as long as you use them correctly	tum bahut se villians le skte ho jab tak ki tum unhe achhe se use krte ho
i agree does the league ever bump heads with crane in the film	han main sehmat huin kya leagu kabhi film mein cran ke saath sir kaatte hai

yes iwas thinking that as well	han main bhi yahi soch raha tha
for sure and i feel like it s all in that bit where sean parker has his line about you know what is cool a billion dollars like it s presented as a way to keep people in touch but it s really the coldest corporate type of thing	sach mein aur mujhe lagta hai ye sab usme bit mein hai jahan sean parker ki line hai you know what is cool a billion dollars like ye aise way mein presented hai ki people touch mein rahein par ye really bohat cold corporate type ki thing hai

then there s that last scene where zuckerberg keeps refreshing his page to see if his ex girlfriend has accepted his friend request that s what it all comes back to after all the greed you ve still got these human needs	aur ek last sceme hai jahan zuckerberg apne page ko refresh karta rahta hai yeh dekhne ke liye ki kya uske ex girlfriend ne uska friend request accept kiya hai ya nahin last mein yehi sab hota hai saare greed ke baad tumhe human needs ki zaroorat hai

hello	hello
hello so the movie we will be talking about is batman v superman	hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai batman v superman
great i haven t actually seen that yet but have been really wanting to which actors play batman and superman	great maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai but sahi me dekhna chahta hu batman aur superman kaun actors bane hai
the actors are really great and you probably know all of them ben affleck henry cavill amy adams and jesse eisenberg to name a few	actor bohot aache hai aur tum shaiyad sabko jante ho ben affleck henry cavill amy adams aur jesse eisenberg kuch naam hai
oh that is a great cast henry cavill played superman in the latest superman film right	oh ye to bohot aachi cast hai henry cavill ne superman ka kirdaar nibhaya tha na latest superman film me
sorry a great cast	maaf karna ek aachi cast
i am not sure but the film is still a part of the dc extended universe also it will be featuring wonder woman	mai nahi bol sakta lekin film ek part hai dc extended universe ka aur vo naya kirdar wonder women bhi dikhayenge
well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman	kyaa lex luthor uksayega batman ko ek ladai ke liye superman ke saath kyunki vo obssessed hai clone superman se
oh so batman is supposed to bring superman to lex luthor	oh batman superman ko lex luthor ke paas lekar jata hai
no that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping by the way did i mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together	nahi ye case nahi hai jabki vo uksata hai madat karne ko kyaa maine bataya ke ye pehli baar hai ke batman aur superman ek saath movie me hai
really the first time that seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long very cool is the story set in metropolis or gotham	sahi me pehli baar ye kaafi aacha sunai deta hai ke kirdaar aas paas rahe hai itne samay se kaafi aacha ye story metropolis me hai ya gotham me
the film appears to take place in both cities and batman comes to view superman as a threat to humanity	film dono jagah hoti hai aur batman superman ko ek khatre ke tarah deekhta hai manavta ke liye
that is interesting to have the film set in both cities so batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take superman down	yeh interesting hai dono cities mein film set hona to batman ne superman ko neecha le jana kuch hadd tak apni duty mani hai
well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because clark kent a k a superman learns of batman s justice methods and tries to expose him all this happening while lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator	khair characters ke relationships kafi complex hai kyunki clark kent a k a superman batman ke justice krne ke tarike sikh gya hai or use expose krne ki koshish krta hai ye sab tab hota hai jan lex luthor ek senator se kryptonite lene ka approval lene ke liye chaalein chalta hai
interesting and so i imagine lois lane is in this story if so does she serve a greater purpose does she know both superheroes	dilachasp aur isliye mujhe lagta hai ki kahani mein lois lane hai agar aisa hai to kya wo koi bada purpose serve kr rahi hai kya use dono superheroes ke baare mein pta hai
maybe but i am not sure by the way do you usually care about reviews	shayad but main sure nhi huin vaise tum aamataur par reviews ki paravaah karte ho
not usually i like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not i watch in theatres i have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed	aamataur par main apana khud ka judge banna pasand karta huin lekin agar reviews bahut bure ya achhe hai to yeh influence kar sakta hai ki main cinema main dekhta hoon ya nahin mujhe is movie ke lie kehna hoga haalaanki reviews kaafi mixed hai
i did i really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman	han mujhe vaastav mein un scenes ko dekhna pasand tha jahaan batman superman ko vash mein karne ke arrangements karta hai
cool i guess that s one of the ultimate questions which one could beat out the other do they team up at all in the film	badiya mujhe lagata hai ki yeh param savaalon mein se ek hai kaun dusre ko hara sakta hai kya ve film mein team up krte hai

that s right she s extroverted and fun	bhohut accha oosi bahirmukhee phir aanand hey
the first part of the movie explaining how the sisters were orphaned and how their circumstances drove them apart was tragic but i do like how everything wrapped up in the end	pratham ansh ka chalachitr samajhaana bahanon ko kaise anaath the aur kaise unake haalaat unhen alag kar diya dukhad tha lekin mujhe pasand hai kaise sab kuchh ant mein lapeta hua

that s correct	yah sahee hai
what is your rating for frozen	phrojan ke lie aapakee reting kya hai
the document is growing and additional detailed information about scenes from the movie were just added i m reminded of the scene where elsa builds her ice palace it was an impressive bit of computer generated animation	dastaavez badh raha hai aur philm ke drshyon ke baare mein atirikt vistrt jaanakaaree bas jod dee gaee mujhe us drshy kee yaad aa rahee hai jahaan elsa apane barph ke mahal ka nirmaan karatee hai yah kampyootar dvaara utpann eneemeshan ka ek prabhaavashaalee sa tha
my favorite scene is when anna gets hitby elsa at the very beginning	mera pasandeeda drshy tab hai jab shuruaat mein hee ena ne elsa ko hit kar diya
the duke of weselton has a name that looks suspiciously like the term weasel	dyook oph vesalatan ka ek naam hai jo spasht roop se vaisal shabd kee tarah dikhata hai
what did you like the least about the film	philm ke baare mein aapako kya pasand aaya
the parents dying was sad and unexpected and a dramatic way to start the film	marane vaale maata pita udaas aur apratyaashit the aur philm shuroo karane ka ek naatakeey tareeka
i have to agree it s the best disney animated film in quite a few years since the lion king	loyan king ke baad se mujhe sahamat hona padega ki yah kuchh saalon mein sabase behatareen dijnee enimeted philm hai

the movie you should see is zootopia	movie jo tumko dekni hai woh hai zootopia
what is zootopia about	kis ke baare mein hai zootopia
its about an optimistic rabbit that joins the zootopia police department while out she runs into a red fox that is also a small time con artist played by jason bateman the movie follows their adventure zootopia	yeh ek optimistic rabbit ke baar mein hai zootopia police department join karta hai jobki woh ek red fox chalati hai aur woh ek small time con artist bhi hai jisko jason bateman ne play kiya hai movie uske zootopia adventure ko follow karti hai
that sounds really interesting how does the movie end	yeh sunne mein toh bhaut interesting hai movie ka end kaisa hai
i would watch it again i saw it in theaters so i am not positive on how it ends but i know that it ends with the rabbit officer proving that she may be small but she wont be intimidated and will do her job to the best of her abilities	han main dubara dekhunga maine ye theater mein dekhi thi so main sahi se nhi bta skta ki ye end kaise hui but mujhe ye pta hai ki ye rabbit officer ke saath end hui thi jo ye saabit krta hai ki wo chhoti ho skti hai par dari hui nhi ho skti or apni ability ke according kam karegi
she sounds like a great officer	wo ek mahan officer ki tarah sound krti hai
she was quite inspiring	wo kafi inspire karti hai
who plays all the voices in the movie	film mein saari awaazein kisne di hai
ginnifer goodwin is officer judy hopps jason bateman plays nick wilde idris elba is chief bogo and jenny slate is dawn bellwether	officer judy hopps ki ginnifer goodwin ne nick wilde ki jason bateman ne chief bogo ki idris elba ne or dawn bellwether ki jenny slate ne awaaz di hai

yes	han
there is some potential for a second movie but i am not sure what they would use for a premise	there is some potential for a second movie par i am not sure iski prishthbhumi ke liye what they would use
thats very true a sequal is easier said than done	ekdum sahi a sequal is easier said than done
they can not try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one since the officer proved her self already	woh can not try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one kyunki officer proved her self already
maybe a little guy can beat the officer	ho sakta hai ki little guy beat the officer
like the rocket snail	rocket snail ki tarah
that could be true but do we want to see a movie where the bad guy wins	woh sahi ho sakta hai but kya hum want to see a movie where the bad guy wins
true but than they could make a third movie where the officer learns how to defeat the guy eventually	sahi hai but than they could make a third movie jahan officer learns bure logo ko kaisse defeat kare
i see your point i fear that you may dissuade people from watching a third movie if they were put off from seeing the villain win in the second movie	i see your point lekin kujhe darr hai ki you may dissuade people from watching a third movie agar unko second movie mein villian ka jeetna pasand nahi aaya
do you think there was a hidden message in the movie	tumhe lagta hai ki movie mein koi hidden message hai
i think the message was to be patient and not judge people or in the movies case animals based on the stereotypes that you have gathered	mere vichar se message tha patience rakhne ka aur logon ko ya is movie ke case mein animals ko judge nahi karne ka based on your stereotypes

hmm you might have to convince me a little more about jaws just because i already know the ending since you said la la land is a romantic comedy is there any romance in jaws	hamm tum mujhe jabade ke baare mein thoda aur samajhaane ke lie ho sakata hai kyonki main pahale se hee ant jaanata hoon jab se aapane kaha tha ki la la laind ek romaantik komedee hai kya joz mein koee romaans hai

so what movie are talking about	to hum kis movie ke baare mein baat kar rahe hain
the wolf of wall street	the wolf of wall street
oh i have heard a lot about that movie	oh maine is movie ke bare mein kafi suna hai
i have never actually seen this movie so what i am reading is all i know about it personally it does not seem like a movie i would like it seems boring and it was given a cinema score of c so that might support my opinion	maine actually kabhi ye movie nahi dekhi to jo maine padha hai mujhe wahi pata hai personally ye aisi movie nahi lagti jo mujhe chi lage ye boring lagti hai aur isey c cinema score mila to shayad ye mere opinion ko support karta hai
oh okay who are the lead actors	oh okay lead actors kon hain
the lead actors are leonardo dicaprio jonah hill margot robbie kyle chandler and rob reiner i do not know who kyle chandler is	lead actors leonardo dicaprio jonah hill margot robbie kyle chandler and rob reiner hain mujhe nahi pata kyle chandler kon hain
i see it was based on a true story	i see ki ye tre story pe based hai
leonardo was nominated for oscar for this	leonardo iske liye oscar nominate hua
where are you located	aap kahaan hain
oh he is a good actor probably deserved it	oh vah ek achchhe abhineta hain shaayad isake hakadaar hain
wolf of wall street is pretty famous in the us	vulph oph vol sadak amerika mein bahut prasiddh hai
it just seemed a little bizarre to me that someone didn t know that movie so i asked	yah sirph mujhe thoda vichitr laga ki koee us philm ko nahin jaanata hai isalie mainne poochha
okay i recommend trying to watch it it s a great movie	theek hai main ise dekhane kee koshish karane kee salaah deta hoon yah ek behatareen philm hai
haha is he right	haaha kya vah sahee hai
yeah sometimes he is right that is why i watch the action movies lol	ha kabhi vo sahi hoti hai ki mai kyo avtion moive dekhta hu
the movie is based on a book	yah mmoive book me based hai
the summary of the movie seems kind of depressing the main character doesn t seem honest and he gets arrested i m guessing he overall learned his lesson since he wrote a book about his life story	ish moive ki summary depressing hai moive ka character imandar nahi malum parta aur vah arrest ho jata hai muje lagta hai vah apni life se seek leta haijab vah book liogta hai
yeah the movie is pretty entertaining the summary might have been written by an emo lol the entire movie is fun other than the last mins or so	ha moive kafi entertaining hai sayad summary emo ne likhi hai puri moive majedar hai last ke das min ke siva
overall he ended up fine has a family and everything	kulmilakar ant acha tha uske pas parivar aur sabkuch tha
he is on tv sometimes as a guest	kuch samay ke liye vah t v par guest tha
oh well that s good i see he went to jail for years that s not too long i wonder if he truly regrets ruining his life or just regrets losing all the money	oh yah thik tha vah teen saal ke liye jail gaya vah jayada time nahi hota achyar use sach me dukh hua apni jingi ka ya keval paise barbad hone ka
he made that money quick and easy while cheating the stock market	usne ashan aur quick paisa kamaya jabki usne stock market ko luta
he must be a really intelligent person what a shame to waste all that talent	vah yek intelligent vaykti tha bari sarm hai ki sara talent barbad ho gaya
years was nothing	saal se kuch nahi
well he still is a millionaire	well voh ab bhi millionaire hein
oh wow that i didn t know and it doesn t say except it says he hid million in a swiss account is that how he s still a millionaire	are wow muje is bare mein kuch nahi patha except us million ka swiss account tho aise hi voh millionaire huve
even if he lost all the money he made previously his movie deal book deal and speaking fees has made him millions	agar voh previously saare money lost kiya tha lekin voh movie ko ache tarah deal kiya book ko bhi aur kahi millions tho apne speaking fees se banaya
do you know if he has a new family because it says his nd wife naomi wanted a divorce and full custody of their children	aapko patha hein agar usse new family hota tho uska nd wife jo naomi tho jarur divorce karthi
he does say that he has made mistakes in his life	voh kahathe hei ki yahi unka life ka mistakes hein
oh well that s good i do like movies and books based on real life stories	acha sahi muje is tarah ka movies jaise real life stories dekhna pasand hein

hey what s the movie name	are movie ka naam kya hai
hello	hello
oh i remember that i haven t seen it but it s about fighting robots	oh mujhe woh yaad hai maine use dekha nahi lekin woh robots se ladai karne ke bare mein hai
interesting in this write up it does not mention robots until the last sentence	dilchasp is write up mein robots ka mention aakhri sentence tak nahi kiya gaya hai
the wolverine actor can t remember his name	the wolverine actor name uska yaad nahi hein
hugh jackman	hugh jackman
yeah that s it	yeah sachi hein
also stars dakota goyo but i do not know her at all assuming iy is a woman	dakota goya star hein lekin muje uske baare mein kuch patha nahi hein
you never know these days with names but i d guess you are right	aajkal is naamon ko patha hi nahi lekin aapka guess right hein
that was probably hugh s love interest in the movie	probably hughs ka love interest hi is movie mein hein
maybe not the role is max	maybe nahi yar role tho max ka hein
so i guess we were wrong	tho hamara guess wrong hoga
do you know how long it is i m not that interested in super long movies anymore	kitna long hein yeh movie muej super long movie ko dekhna interested nahi hein
also stars evangeline lilly woman for sure	evangeline lilly ek mahila hai
yeah that must be the love interest	ha ye pyar mai interest hai
did you like the movie	tumhe film pasand hai
the plot makes it seem like wwe	sari jaga wwe ki tra lag rhi hai
i haven t seen it it looked ok in the previews though	maine nhi dekha wo acha hai maine preview dekha hai
how so	kaise ho
fighting robots	ladai ke robots
and i guess hugh used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems and they weren t good anymore	aur mujhe lagata hai ki hyoog robot kee ladaee mein achchha hua karata tha lekin tab unhen kuchh samasyaen theen aur ve ab achchhe nahin the
but then they find a better robot and are good again	lekin phir ve ek behatar robot dhoondhate hain aur phir se achchhe hote hain
seemed like a simplistic popcorn movie from the previews	previews se lagtha hein ki yeh kuch simplistic popcorn movie hein
i guess not wwe but boxing less humans just robots	wwe ka tho nahi hein lekin boxing less humans aur robots ke tho jarur hoga
honestly it seems dumb orobably why i did not see it	honestly muje dumb lagtha kuch dekhai nahi detha
probably made my disney too so it could be a kiddy movie	probably yeh disney ka hein jo kiddy movie hein
does not sound kiddy	kiddy ke tarah kuch sound nahi aatha
not little kids	choti kids ke nahi
like the kind of movie you d take a year old to	saal ka kids ke hein
yeah it definitely sounds like that	ha ye definitely uski tarah sound karta he
probably a feel good movie where they conquer all	probably ye ek feel good movie he jisme vi sabkuch conquer kar lete he
like what the main plot is about	jese ki main plot kis bare me he
yeah except nobody is crazy like the brad pitt character	ha koi bhi other character brad pitt ke character ki tarah crazy nahi he
illegal mush be done out of the view of the law	illegal law ki view ke outside kiya jana chahiye
i don t think it was illegal	me nahi sochta ki illegal tha
maybe though	although hosakta he
like it was an athletic specacle	wo ek athletic specacle jesa tha
the write up says now working as a small time promoter charlie pieces together scrap metal into low end fighters barely earning enough to make it from one underground venue to the next	write up bol raha he ki aap ek small time promoter ki tara he charlie pieces scrap metal into low end fighters barely utna kama raha heki wo usme sebek underground venue to the next
yup that s the struggle	ha wo struggle tha
then they find an amazing robot and get their revenge	bad me wo ek amazing robot find kar rahe the aur bdla liya
so he starts out as illegal then moves up in the world	usne illegap start kiya bad me world me move up ho gaye
makes sense	samaj me aata he
rotten tomatos rating	rotten tomatoes ke fifty nine percent rating he
who cares about rotten tomatoes their reviews are worthless	rotton tomatoes kaun care karta he uske reviews worthless he
says it was made by dream works is that adisney company	kaho wo dream works ne banaya he jo adisney company he
look up your fav movies on that site and i guarantee you ll be disappointed by the low scores	tum es site par apni manpasand films dekho aur main guarantee se kehta hoon ke itna kmm score dekh ke nirash ho jaoge
no i think they compete with disney	nhi main sochta hoon ke uhno ne disney poora kar lia
they make similar animated movies	woh ek tran ki animated movies bnate hain
it seems disney buys up everyone	aisa lagta hai disney ne sab kuch khareed lia
yeah they are a giant company	hanji woh ek bade company hai
gives another rating of metric score	woh hor rating deti hai metric score
that is probably a rating at a different site	yeh ton pkka ek alag rating hai site pe
i ve done this before and usually they provide rating systems	maine ye pehla bhi kia hai aur har baar je rating system dete hain
rottoen tomatoes something else then a cine something rating	rotten tomatoes eske ila a kuch hor cine rating
also stars olga fonda is she related to jane fonda henry fonda	osne hero olga fonda hai kya woh jane fonda henry fonda ki najdiki hai
they always have suspiciously high ratings	uske hamesha suspicously jyaada ratings hain
seems like olga was born in russia so no much better looking than henry or jane	lagta hai olga ka janam russia me hua tha so nahin henry or jane ko dekhne se much better hai
lol	lol
ok	ok
bye	bye
hello	me apna head bow karta hu
hello today we re gon na talk about how to train your dragon	i bow mera sar today hum bat karne wale he ki tumhare dragon ko train kese kare
awesome no i have not had the chance is it good	bahut badiya nahi mujhe chance nahi mila kya ye good hua
yes it has great ratings it is rated on rotten tomatoes	yes iskogreat rating mili he rotten tomatoes par iski rating he
who is in it is it an animated movie	kon he isme kya ye ek animated movie he
the cast includes gerard butler craig ferguson and america ferrera	iski cast me gerard butler craig ferguson and american ferrera ko include kiya gaya he
omg craig ferguson is a riot	hea god craig ferguson to swayam hi riot he
yes he does such a great job the d work is truly magical	ha voh bahut hi great perform karta he d work to really magical he
what is it about besides the obvious of dragon training of course	kis baare me hai obvious dragon training ko chhod ke
one of the best scenes is when the dragon hiccup is attacked by the bad guy night fury and rather than killing him he sets him free	best scenes me se ek hai jab dragon hiccup ko bad guy night fury attack aur hai aur usne maarne k bajaye jaane deta hai
so the dragon s name is hiccup	to dragon ka naam hiccup hai
okay night fury freed hiccup then	accha night fury hiccup ko chhod deta hai phir
another important scene is when hiccup s owner sees that night fury is hurt and can not fly he makes him a prostectic wing and thats how he teaches him how to fly	ek aur mahatvapoorn drshy hai jab hichakee ke maalik ne dekha ki nait phyooree ko chot lagee hai aur vah ud nahin sakata hai vah use ek prosthetik ving banaata hai aur vah use udane ka tareeka sikhaata hai
which part did craig ferguson give	craig ferguson ne kaun sa bhaag diya
i meant to say which part did craig ferguson play	mere kahane ka matalab hai craig ferguson ne kaun sa bhaag khela
he played gobber the belch who was the training masters of the young warriors	unhonne gobar da belch kee bhoomika nibhaee jo yuva yoddhaon ke prashikshan ke svaamee the
were the warriors humans or dragons	yoddha manushy the ya dregan
well if you only like him then maybe no because his role is not a main role if you like movies of the same genre then it may be a good fit	yadi aap keval use pasand karate hain to shaayad nahin kyonki usakee bhoomika mukhy bhoomika nahin hai agar aap ek hee jonar kee philmen pasand karate hain to yah ek achchhee phit ho sakatee hai
it is a great movie to watch with children	bachchon ke saath dekhana ek behatareen philm hai
the warriors were humans and they were mostly kids they owned and trained the dragons	yoddha manushy the aur ve jyaadaatar bachche the ve dregan ke svaamitv aur prashikshit the
do you like movies like this	apko aisi movie pasand hai
i m guessing that since the movie was aimed towards children that it had a happy ending yes i like some of them i don t go for a lot of singing in the animated movies though with the exception of the wizard of oz that was a great movie i could watch it over and over	mera anuman ha ki jo movie balko ke liye banai jati hai wo happy ending hai ha mujhe aisi pasand hai mai animated movies me jyada gane ke sath me nahi hu the wizard of oz ek achhi movie hai mai use bar bar dekh sakta hu
yes it has a happy ending thats great theres no singing in this film i think this is a feel good film	ha wo happy ending wali hai thats great film me gane nahi hai mujhe ye film achhi sunai padti hai
it had great reception and even has sequels	yas acchha reception tha aur usme keval sequels hi the
sounds like it i would probably like it	acchi sunai padti he mujhe wo acchhi lagegi
the fight scenes do tend to get kind of violent but they are very immerssoive	fight scenes thode violent hai lekin woimmerssoive hai
hi	hi

who doesn t like princesses whats the story line like	princesses kise pasand nahi story line kya hai waise

haha i guess that s true i do prefer realism but i do appreciate that disney throws in adult concepts in children s stories that go right over children s heads	haaha mujhe lagata hai ki yah sach hai main realism ko pasand karata hoon lekin main appreciate karata hoon ki disney bachchon kee kahaaniyon mein adult concepts dalta hai jo bachchon ke sir par seedhee jaata hain
haha yeah they always do that dont they	haaha yes ve hamesha aisa nahin karate hain

yes	han
wow	waah
so she was originally a fairy	to wo asal mein mein ek fairy thi
yes	han

i think i only heard about this movie once	i think maine is movie ke baare me sirf ek baar suna hai
oh wow	oh wow

and maleficent loves him	aur maleficent use pyar karti hai
oh boy	oh shaana
she sends stefan to his death	voh tho stefan ko mouth ke muh me daal diya
they changed it for it to only get a rating	isse changed ke liye rating deya hein
this film wanted to break the stereotype	is film tho stereotype ko break kar liya
but it was too much	lekin yeh tho kuch jyada hein yar
righy	right
right	right
they fixed it when it wasnt broken	voh fix kar sakthe the lekin voh broken hi nahi tha
yea	yea
it was too much	yeh kuch jyada hi hey
and i havent heard about that director	aur mein iska director ke baare mein bhi kuch suna nahi haei
it probably takes a lot to direct a movie like this	probably kuch samay lagega is tarah ka movies ko direct karna
i think u are right	i think tum sahi ho
but its metacritic score was ow	par uska metacritic score tha
really low	bahut kam
from what i hear angelina jolie performed really well in it	jahaan se meine suna hai angelina jolie ne bahut achcha perform kiya hain usme
well i love her	well mujhe pyaar karta hoon usse
not like that	aise hi nahin

she is a good actress	wo ek achchi actress hai
there is a scene where aurora is a little girl and she goes up to maleficent	ek scene hai jisme aurora choti ladki hai aur wo maleficent ke paas jati hai
and they had to use angelinas daughter	aur unhe angelina ki daughter use karni padi
oh really	oh sach mein
because her daughter was the only one who wouldnt get scared and run away lol	kyunki uski daughter akeli thi jo scare hokar bhaagti nahi
so i like that	han mujhe ye acha laga
yea	han
but the critical responses	par critical responses

hey there s this movie called bruce almighty with jim carrey in it have you seen it or would you like to	hey ek movie hai bruce almighty jisme jim carrey hai kya tumne dekhli ya dekhna chahoge
i haven t seen it	maine nahi dekhi
what s it about	tho yeh kis baare ka hein
no it s a comedy	nahi yeh comedy hein
no it is not	nahi isme nahi hein
too bad i like romantic comedies	too bad muje romantic comedies pasand hein
have you ever seen how to train your dragon	tumne kabhi tumhare dragon ko kaise train karna deka he
yes i have it is a lovely movie	ha mere pas he wo lovely movie hai
it is an animation fantasty movie that came out in	wo animation fantasty movie he jo do hajar dus me aayi thi
which character do you like best	konsa character best hein yar
it is animation that is voiced by jay baruchel hiccup horrendous haddock iii and gerard butler stoick the vast	yeh tho animation ka hein iska voiced tho jay baruchel yaani hiccup horrendous haddock iii aur gerad butler stoick the vast ne deya
the movie has everything from d computer animation to action fantasty	movie tho sab d computer animation ka hein
it is a dreamworks animation that was distributed by paramount pictures	yeh tho dreamworks ka animation ka hein uska distributed tho paramount pictures hein
and alot different that the actual books	kaafi different actual book bhi hein
the books are more comedy	is book tho badi comedy hein
intersting i did not know that	interesting hey tho muje nahi patha
did you like the interactions with the characters	tumhe characters k sath interaction acche lage
oh yes very much	oh haan kafi
which character do you like the most	tumhe kaunsa character sabse jyada pasand aaya
toothless is my favorite dragon	toothless mera favorite dragon hai
toothless is a great character hiccup was supposed to kill him in the beginning but couldn t bring himself to do it and instead sets him free	toothless ek great character hai hiccup asal me use maarne wala tha but mar nahi paya aur use free kar diya
he gradually tames the dragon and calls him toothless because of his retractable teech	wo gradually dragon ko tame karta hai aur use toothless bulata hai kyuki uske retractable teeth hai
it was becuase of toothless that hiccup learned how to tame other dragons	toothless ki wajah se hiccup baki dragons ko bhi tame karna seekh gaya
he become proficient in subduing the captive dragons i don t know how much you can call that cheating	wo captive dragons ko vas karne me kushal ho gaya uko aap cheating kaise keh sakte hai
but he wouldn t have known that without having toothless	lekin wo ye toothless ke bina nahi jan pata
so maybe just an advantage not cheating	to sayad wo advantage ho cheating nahi
how do you feel about how stoick treats hiccup	aapko kya lag raha he ki stoick hiccup ke sath kya kar raha hai
stoick leaving hiccup but then arriving home unscucessful and finding how hiccup had trained the dragons led to a celebration	stoick hiccup ko chhod raha hai lekin phir ghar mein becheni se pahuncha aur paaya ki hiccup ne dragons ko kis tarah prashikshit kiya tha
i mean throughout the whole movie he was rather harsh to him in the beginning	mera matalab hai puri movie ke dauran vah suruat mein usake prati kathor nahin tha
stoick uses hiccup when hiccups accidently reveals that toothless can locate the dragon s nest stoick disowns his son	stoick hiccup ka upayog karata hai jab hiccups ko akasmik rup se pata chalata hai ki toothless dragon ke ghosle ka pata laga sakata hai stoick ne apane bete ko nanga kar diya
that to me is very harsh	mere liye yah bahut harsh hai
however when hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless stoick saves them both reconciling with his son	halaki jab hiccup lagabhag toothless ko chhudane ki koshish mein doob jata hai to stoick apane bete ke saath un dono ko bacha leta hai
hey	hey
hi	hi
how s it going	kaisa chal raha hai
pretty good are you a marvel fan	kaafi accha kya tum marvel fan ho

i guess it s just a very good movie with an amazing plot	i guess ye ek acchi movie thi ek amazing plot k saath
loki using clint barton to help him with the tesseract was awesome too i like him even though he s a bad guy	taissairacht ke saath unakee madad karane ke lie loki ne klint baartan ka upayog kiya jo bahut hee bhayaanak tha main use pasand karata hoon bhale hee vah ek bura aadamee ho
right that was a great scene	sahee vah ek behatareen drshy tha
loki s a likable villain i d say	loki ke ek yogy khalanaayak hai jo main kahata hoon
it was interesting how it caused such a riff within the avengers thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie	yah dilachasp tha ki avengers ke bheetar is tarah kee daraar kaise huee thor ko ab bhee aisa lag raha tha ki philm ke dauraan unhonne lambe samay tak unake prati vaphaadaaree kee hai
you think	aapako lagata hai
i thought he was pretty ruthless with him	mainne socha ki vah usake saath bahut kroor tha
that s just my opinion obviously	yah sirph meree raay hai
the end fight scene definitely was he could have killed him	antim phait seen jaroor tha vah use maar sakata tha

sandra s friends in the movie criticize the actor wondering why she would adopt a black kid very empowering	movie mein sandra ke friends actor ko criticize karte hain hairan hote huye ki wo black kid ko kyun adopt kar rahi hai bohat empowering
sandra goes against her friends wills and keeps raising micahel	sandra apne friends ki will ke against jaati hai aur micahel ko raise karti rehti hai
so does the movie have a lot of football in it	to kya movie mein kafi footbal hai
not as much as you would think its about football a lot of the movie is about whats going on behind the scenes with his family issues	itna nahi jitna tum soch rahe hoge ye football ke baare mein hai kafi movie is baare mein hai ki behind the scenes uske family issues mein kya chal raha hai
michael gets into a fight with people back home because that make sexual jokes about his new mom	michael back home ke logon ke sath fight mein pad jaata hai kyunki wo uski new mom ke baare mein sexual jokes banate hain
ah ok my husband really likes football so he might be interested i like sports movies when they have good character development	ah ok mera husband really football like karta hai to wo interested ho sakta hai main sports movies like karta hun jab unme achi character development ho
michael stands up for his mom and gets into a fight	michael apni mom ke liye khada hota hai aur fight mein padta hai

it s really great what mark ruffalo did as bruce banner the hulk making him so calm yet ready to become a volcano don t you think	yeh tho acha huva ki mark ruffalo ne bruce banner yaani hulk ko calm kiya aur voh volcano ke liye ready huva hey na
strictly this may be his main potential	strictly yeh tho main potential hein
robert downey is my favorite favorite character	robert downey ne mera favorite character hein
no he is right	nahi yar voh thik tha
that opening with the tesseract escape was pretty cool setting the tone for the movie	yeh tho tesseract ka opening escape plan tha voh cool hein isseme uska tone ache sett huva
may be that was the reason for the film s success	isliye us film ka success ho saktha hein
it refers to image capture skills	wo image capture skills k baare me hai
please chat me fast	please mujhse chat karo fast
it s their nature and it s impossible	wo unka nature hai aur wo impossible hai
i guess so i wonder what the deal is with the leader of those chitauri very mysterious	i guess so wo chithauri k leader ka kya maamla hai kaafi mysterious
it was a mystery to the last	wo bilkul last tak mystery thi
for this film at least i guess it was pretty sad when coulson died did that scene get you	kam se kam is film k liye jab coulson mara wo kaafi sad tha us scene me kuch laga tumhe
there is a glimpse of seeing	waha ek jhalak hai dekhne ki
there is no need	yaha koi jarurat nahi hai
absolutely beat on loki like the hulk did who kicked the most butt do you think	ek dam halk ne kiya pasand kiya aap ka kya sochna hai butt mei kisane jyada kick kiya
i think so	mene socha ki
i like hulk too	mughe halk bhi pasand hai
yeah he s the best it s great that the whole team had to work together to save the day in the end don t you think	haa ye bahut acvha hai ye puri team mei bahut mahan hai ye sath mei kam karta hai tum kya sochte ho
i knew and i thought	mughe malum hai mei shocha bhi
there were certainly some high stakes with that nuclear missile heading for new york	yaha vaha bahut jayada stakes hai or nuclear missile hai new york mei
hi there	sabhi ko hi
hey	hey
so what did you think of the movie	so aap movie ke baare me kya sochte ho
what about you	apke baare me kya
yes it looks like michael oher experience a lot of hardship growing up	yes aisa lagta hai ki michael other ko bahut hardship experience ho rahi hogi
experienced	experienced
yeah seems like he beat the odds drastically it just goes to show you that hard work and a little bit of luck can get you far in life	yeah aisa lagta hai ki wo mushkilo ko drastically beat kar deta hai ye is tarah se show karta hai ki hard work aur thoda luck aapko life me bahut aage le jaata hai
i agree	i agree
he definitely made it from the bottom	yeh jarur apni mehenath se bana hoga
and tim mcgraw	aur tim mcgraw ka bhi
those are some big names	voh tho bada bada naam hein yar
haha i was about to say that	ha ha mein bhi yahi bolne vaala tha
it has some great reviews too	kuch ache reviews bhi hein
definitely it also shows what kind of person he is by him withholding his strength at first	definitely isse patha chaltha ki voh kaise tarah ka log hein jo uska strength pehla dekhayi detha
it is a shame that leigh anne s friends did not approve of what she was doing	badi shame hey yar jo leigh anne ka friends nei approve nahi kiya
though thank goodness leigh anne is strong willed	acha huva uska goodness leigh anne nei strongly willed hein
it s crazy how he was approached by gang members when he went to go see his biological mother	yeh tho crazy hein yar jab voh apni biological mother ke paas approach kar rahe thi
it s good that he chose the right path though	acha tho voh yeh right path chose kiya hoga
true but it made him stronger of a person it also most likely made him realize he didn t belong with the criminals especially after they were making sexual comments about the same person who was taking care of him	sach isliye usse stronger ban saktha usko realize bhi nahi huva ki voh yek criminals ke belong nahi hey aur jab koi sexual comments kare ise person ke baare mein jo itna care karte
that is what probably made him decide that life was not for him when someone talks that way about someone you love you know they are not your true friend	isse karan us ne soch liya ki zindahgi uske liye nahin hain agar koi aisi baat kisi ke bare me jise tum pyaar karthe ho to tum malum hain ki yeh thmhare sachha dost nahin hai
hello	namaste

i acutally havent seen the full movie	mainne pooree philm nahin dekhee hai
the movie is really scary despite the fact the shark is only shown full body at the end	philm vaastav mein daraavanee hai is tathy ke baavajood ki shaark ko keval ant mein poorn shareer dikhaaya gaya hai
thats cool	yah achchha hai
why you never watched the whole movie	aapane pooree philm kyon nahin dekhee

yeah same here looks like rotten tom atoes and metacritic didn t score the movie very well	han mujhe bhi rotten tomatoes aur metacritic ki tarah lag rha hai movie to achhe se score nhi kiya
i ve never heard of cinemascore but they seem to think highly of it	maine cinemascore ke baare mein sunna nhi lekin ve iske baare mein bahut sochte hai
i ve never heard of lisa ann walter but i assume she plays jennifer aniston s sister or mother in this it doesn t say if they find out if he is g d or not	maine lisa ann walter ke baare mein kabhi nhi suna lekin mujhe lagta hai ki wo jennifer aniston ki sister ya mother ka role play kr rahi hai yahan nhi bataya gya wo g d hai ya nhi
same here never heard of the side characters i have no idea who philip baker hall is he isn t sharing any simiar character last name so i m guessing he might play a friend	yaah bhi mein side characters ke baare mein kuch suna nahi muje philip baker hall ka koi idea nahi voh simiar character share kar raha hein uska last name tho uska friend neh play kiya hein
hello	hello
hello	namste
hello	namste
how are you	kaise ho
i m good you	me accha hu aap
yes	ha
now is the based on critic reviews or users	critic reviews aur users ke base pe fifty two percent he
to me the older versions of themselves really struck a chord with me	mere liye unke older version really struck a chord with me
maybe it wasn t as great based on its technical merits	maybe technical merits pe wo itni acchi nahi thi
sometimes movies can be enjoyable regardless	kabhi kabhi movies enjoyable ho sakti hai regardless
possibly to me it s just the perfect example of two lovers forever struggling to be together	possibly mere liye ye do lovers ka sath hone k liye struggle ka perfect example hai
thats actually a great way to put it	actually ye bahut accha tareeka hai batane ka
did you have a favorite scene	tumhara koi favorite scene hai
the older versions of themselves was just the most touching part of this movie till the end they stayed together even when she no longer knew who he was it s just so touching	unke older versions is movie ka sabse touching part tha wo end tak sath rahe even jab usko pata nahi tha wo kaun thi ye bahut touching tha
i don t have a favorite lol i just loved this movie as a whole some parts and scenes were more touching than others but it s just an overall love for the entire movie	mera koi favorite nahi he lol mujhe to bas whole movie se love he kuch parts aur scenes others se adhik touching the but ye overall love he entire movie ke liye
yes it is	yes bilkul he
i can t imagine losing my counterpart like that	me apne counterpart ka is tarah se khona imagine bhi nahi kar sakti
i can t believe that its been out for years though i saw it at the theaters too lol	me believe nahi kar sakta ki ye sal ke liye outside raha he although mene ise theaters me bhi dekha he lol
me either i dont know which is worse having somebody die completely or just their memory	mene either me nahi janata kon sa worse he kisi ka completely mar jana ya just unki memory ka mar jana
yeah it s been a long time since i saw it but i still remember it like it was yesterday lol	yeah kafi long time ho gaya he ise dekhe but ye mujhe still ease remember he like yesterday hi dekha tha lol
yeah really makes me think	yeah really mujhe ye sochne par badhya karta he
it does	ha it does badhya
now i have the urge to watch it again lol	now mujhe urge he ise again watch karne ki lol
good thing i still have it on dvd	good bat ye he ki ye mere pas still dvd me he
i ve always hated the way parents intercepted relationships the way anne did keeping people apart based on money	jis tarah se parents ne intercepted relationship isse mujhe always hate thi anne ne jis tarah se kiya money ke basis par people ko apart rakhna
i ll wait until the wifey gets home though that should get me out of the dog house	me wait karoonga wifey ki home return hone tak ye sambhvta mujhe dog house se bahar rakhe
lol i d love to see it again myself	lol me myself ise dekhna pasand karu
jim carrey is a great actor that has had a lot of major roles in movies what is your favorite movie with jim carrey	jim carrey badhiya actor hai aur bahut movies me major role kiya hai tumhari jim carrey ki favorite movie kaunsi hai
i enjoyed that bruce almighty was a comedy because i enjoy a good laugh i also liked how the movie introduced god which not many movies do what did you like most about bruce almighty	muujhe bruce almighty acchi lagi kyuki wo comedy thi aur mujhe comedy pasand hai mujhe ye bhi accha laga kaise usme god aya jo ki sab movies me nahi ata tumhe bruce almighty me sabse jyada accha kya laga
yes i liked the role of morgan freeman as god also i also like the setting of the movie which is memorable to me because im from buffalo	han mujhe god ke role mein morgan freeman ka character bahut pasand aaya mujhe film ki setting bhi pasand hai jo mere liye yaadgaar hai kyunki im buffalo se
oh that is interesting morgan freeman is another great actor his voice can be used in many settings and roles	oh yeh to intresting hai morgan freeman bhi ek or achha actor hai uski awaaz bahut si settings and roles mein use ki jaa skti hai
if you were in a similar situation as bruce like in the key scene mentioned would you feel frustrated as well	tho bruce yaani keyscene ke tarah lag raha hein kya aapko thoda frustrated feel hota hein
i probably wouldn t only because that would be a lot of responsibility to take care of everything in the entire world but i would like to eliminate suffering in people what about you	nahi yar kyon ki muje aur koi kaam hein kyon ki kaafi logon isse suffer hote hein aapka kya haal chaal hein
maybe through some type of app which is more modern now do you think bruce and grace made a good couple	hosaktha ab sabhi mordern tho hein kuch app bhi ho saktha kya bruce aur grace vaakahi mein ache couple the
what do you think he learned the most about being god for the week	aapko kya lagtha hein ki voh god se kya sikha hoga
jaws was such a good movie	jaws kya good movie thi
i agree it was well made	me agree karta hu yah well made thi
the scares were well timed	scares well timed the
i liked the soundtrack	mene soundtrack like kiya
what was your favorite part	tumhara favorite part kon sa tha
that makes sense yes especially the part that it is so famous for the sound they played whenever they wanted to increase the audience s fear and anxiety	isme sense he ha especially voh part jiske liye ye itna famous he jab bhi ve audience ki fear aur anxiety badana chahte the unhone ye sound play kiya
just another affirmation that spielberg knew what he was doing even in post production	ek dusra affirmation ki spielberg knew ki voh post production me kya kar raha tha
no doubt he is very good at making movies no it is not my favorite kind i am not much into jump scares i like documentaries how about you	isamen koee shak nahin vah philmen banaane mein bahut achchhe hain nahin yah meree pasandeeda kism nahin hai main bahut jyaada dara hua nahin hoon mujhe vrttachitr pasand hain aap kaise hain
that is understandable halloween is a good time to scare yourself	yah samajh mein aata hai hailoveen khud ko daraane ka ek achchha samay hai
what did you think of the mayor s reaction to the shark attack	shaark ke hamale par meyar kee pratikriya ke baare mein aapane kya socha
exactly i thought it was neat to think of real world implications both fiscally and morally	theek mainne socha tha ki vaastavik duniya ke nihitaarth ko naitik aur naitik roop se donon ke baare mein sochana saaph tha
of how to present this to the public	ise janata ke saamane kaise pesh kiya jae
which in the end resulted in a shark hunting frenzy	jisake parinaamasvaroop ant mein ek shaark shikaar unmaad paida hua
i like to think of those things too i did not like that part i think i would have liked it better if the shark was led out to sea but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that not enough drama	un cheejon ke baare mein bhee sochana pasand karate hain mujhe vah hissa pasand nahin tha mujhe lagata hai ki shaark ko samudr tak le jaaya jaata to mujhe achchha lagata lekin jyaadaatar log shaayad us tarah kee philm ka aanand nahin lenge paryaapt naatak nahin
you are right on that	aap us par sahee hain
it was nice to see characters such as brody step up though it took his son to go into shock in order to spur him to action	brodee ke kadam jaise charitron ko dekhana achchha tha haalaanki isane unake bete ko kaarravaee ke lie prerit karane ke lie sadame mein le liya
money seems to always be highest priority	paisa hamesha sarvochch praathamikata lagata hai
unfortunately true	durbhaagyavash yah sach hai

hi i ve really enjoyed the movie real steel it was a great movie that was full of adventure	hi muje real steel ka movie tho enjoy kartha aur voh movie tho pura adventure hein
seems kinda like a typical family action film with some scifi elements	typical family action ka film ke tarah lag raha hein kuch scifi elements
was kinda cool tho	kuch cool hein
yes it is sort of the family type of film but i got very much into the characters especially hugh jackman s	han is film kuch family type ka hein lekin muje is characters jo especially hugh jakman se bahut impress hein
was interesting to see hugh play a more domestic role	hugh ko dekhne ka bahut interesting hein jo domestic role play karte
normally he s always a loner fighter type	normally voh lone fighter type ke hein
i always find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can get into i think he fit in with everyone else really well	maine hamesha yeh interesting paya ki actors kis type ka demands kar sakte hai mujhe lagta hai wo sab ke sath thik se fit hai
yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture	yeh hai ek unusual mix actors ka jo bana ek coherent mixture
that s definitley true	yeh definitley true hai
the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movie s world	naye paragraph se mujhe robot ke interesting factor ka pata chala is movie world ke
like he s just a lower class dude but he owns a fighting robot	woh ek lower class ladka hai par uske paas ek fighting robot hai
yeah seeing the draw of their world and how these robots are just sort of common was something that i really liked as well	yeh dikh raha hai kaise woh world se draw hue hai aur kaise ye robots sirf ek common chiz hai jo mujhe pasand bhi hai
also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesn t make all problems go away	yeh kaafi interesting point ubharta hai ki improved technology se problems gaye nahi hain
yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change they ll just come about in a new way	kuch bhi ho lekin life issues ko kabhi change nahi hote voh kahi new way mein aa hi jaatha
that was a pretty good scene the new paragraph	kaafi ache scene hein is new paragraph mein
kind of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy son but eventually they fought their way back	hint ke tarah hein kuch guy ka yaad aatha jo eventually aapas mein fought kiye the
cool to see the human spirit reflected in robots	cool he us robots ko human spirit se dekhne ka
it s just the classic underdog story told in a somewhat different way there will always be trials and triumphs	yeh tho classic underdog story jo different way mein kaha gaya hein trials aur triumphs tho aathe jaathe hein
as long as humans are around we ll never really intrinsically change	jab tak humans aapas mein aathe tab tak hum kabhi intrinsically change nahi karte
nothing intrinsic is lost	intrinsic tho kuch nahi hein
right i suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans more so than the actual humans that s a really interesting concept i think	sahi hei kahi log tho robots ko human ke tarah dekhne lagthe lekin actual humans tho behetar hein really interesting concept hein yar
kinda reminds me of virtual reality	virtual reality ka yaad aaya
humanity lives on but through the robots	humanity tho jinda rahega lekin robots
even though the robots are doing the action their action is still fully human	robots kitna bhi kaam karega lekin lagtha tho human ki tarah hi

yeah but it was not a logical story	han but ye ek logical story nhi thi
nobody have a vengeance for their puppy got killed	kisi ne bhi puppy ke maare jane ka badla nhi liya
it is what they call neo noir i guess that means it is not supposed to make sense because it is an altered reality	ise voh neo noir call karte he mujhe lagta he that means iska koi sense nahi he because ye ek altered reality he
yes i watched the whole movie	yes mene whole movie dekhi

the next scene they mention is how the girl s mother hides the boy s letters from her because she doesn t want her daughter to be with him	next scene mein wo mention karte hain ki ladki ki maa kaise boy ke letters ladki se hide karti hai kyunki wo nahi chahti uski beti uske sath rahe

they praise the performances but criticize the sappy writing	unlogo ne performance ki tarrif ki hai par sappy writing ki ninda ki hai

i m tempted to check it out now though	lekin ab main check out karne k liye tempt ho raha hu
cool sounds like an interesting story	cool interesting story sound karti hai
they were definitely trying to promote a message of not being blindly forced into a way of life culture just because the older men thought that way	wo definitely ek way of life culture me blindly force na hone ka message promote kar rahe the just becasuse older aadmi aise sochte hai
he ends up convincing the others to live in harmony with the dragons instead of killing them	akhir me wo sabhi ko dragons ko maarne k bajay unke saath harmony me rahne k liye convince kar leta hai
the battle scenes are really cool the animation was great for that movie	ee ladai ka scenes tho bahut cool hi ee animation tho bahut aacha hi movie me
i didn t know that it was the same people who made lilo stitch	me re kho nahi pata jho same log banaya hi jho banaya tha lilo stich

yea i actually might watch it myself instead	ha mene actually deka hi
i may have had it on for background noise at some point i honestly dont recall	me re thoda background noise huwa tha mene honestly call nahi karungi
i m trying to figure out who jonah hill was in the movie	mene try kar raha hi khoun hi vo jonah hill ee movie me
imdb says he was one of the kids in the dragon training classes	imbd ne bataya hai ki waha ek bachha hai dragon training class mein
they all had to take classes about how to kill their first dragon	woh sab class leye hai ki kaise pehla dragon ko maar sakte hai
he is quite funny too	woh bahut funny hai
for the scenes where he snorted cocaine they were using vitamin d power and he had snorted so much of it he had a vitamin d overdose and had to go to the hospital	yeh scene mein jaha woh cocaine le raha tha usne yaha vitamin d use kiya aur vitamin d ki overdose ho gayi aur use hospital jana para

hey there	suno
hello	hello
how are you	aap kaise hain
thank you i am fine	shukriya main teek hoon
have you seen the movie	aap movie dekha hain
its a great movie	yeh bahut achha movie hain
lol	lol
the movie maleficent is also a great look at the untold story of sleeping beauty	movie maleficient bhi bahut achhi hain aur sleeping beauty ke ankaha kahani dekho
yes its true	han yeh sahi hai
well sleeping beauty its an old movie bud really good	khair sleeping beauty ek purani movie hai but bahut achhi hai
so very true i just like the digital look of the fairytale setting that plays off the original animated scenery	bilkul sahi mujhe fairytale setting ka digital look pasand hai jo original animated scenery dikhata hai
this movie did cause me to loathe king stefan though i mean he tore her wings off	iss movie ne raja stefan ko kam karne ke liye kiya mera matlab usne apne wings kaat diye
yes and no i find that the animated films are quite nostalgic but the live action films like maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the films cater better to me nowawdays	han ye nhi mujhe lagta hai ki animated movies bahut nostalgic hoti hai lekin live action movies jaise maleficent jis mein tum film ke peechhe andhera dekh skte ho ajakl zyada behtar hai mere
true i think you are a good movie reader	sach mujhe lagta hai ki tum ek achhe movie reader ho
though i do find the jerry burckheimer productions better than robert stromberg who did maleficent	halanki mujhe jerry burckheimer productions better lagti hai robert stromberg jisne maleficent banayi thi
yes you are correct	han tum sahi ho
but maleficent has a far more heartbreaking background than the pirates movies the background of maleficent and even the fact taht she cared for aurora despite her villian status makes her likeable and hateable at the same time	but maleficent ka background zyada heartbreaking and pirate movies se maleficient ka background aur ye fact ki wo aurora ki care krti hai jabki uska ek villan ka status hote hue bhi use likeable or hateable dono ek hi samay pe banata hai
which ones are your favorite movies animated or action	tumhari konsi movies favorite hai animated ya action
how many times have you seen this movie	tumne yeh movie kitni baar dekhi hai
i quite have not seen the whole movie	maine yeh saari movie nhi dekhi
yes me too	han main bhi
what parts have you seen	tumne konse parts dekhe hai
to be honest i dont really remember much	sach kahu to mujhe zyada yaad nhi hai
i mean i do give them credit for the live action of the whole phillip rescuing aurora from maleficent thing but even with computers and the live action none of it did justice to the animated version where she turns into the dragon	mera matlab hai ki main use pure philip ki live action ke liye credit deta huin jo ki sirf maleficient ki cheezon se aurora ko bachate hain but yahan tak ki computers aur live action ke saath in mein se kisi ne bhi animated version ke saath justice nhi ki jahan wo dragon mein badal jati hai
plus they added a darker element where king stefan also falls to his death	unhone uske upar kala element add kiya uske vajahse raja stefan mar gaya
well i do remember that part	ha mujhe wo part yad hai
are you into movies critics	tum movie crtics ho kya
eh i do take looks at rotten tomatoes here and there	ha me rotten tomatoos pe dekhta rehata hu idhar udhar
they hated this movie by the way lol	unhe ye movie pasand nahi aayi lol
you seen to well know much about the whole production kind	lagta hai tumhe pura pata hai production tak
lol	has raha hu jorse
have you seen this movie	aap movie dekha hai
i just saw it	ha maine abi kuch der pahale dekha hoon
have you seen it	aap dekha hai
no i usually like stuff with benedict cumberpatch though	nahi main benedict cumberpatch jaise movie dekhtha hoon
it was such a thrilling movie based on the life of alan turing	woh bada romanchakari movie tha woh alan turing ke jeevan ke bare me tha
keira knightly slightly annoys me however	keira knightly mujeh achi nahi lagtha
cumberbach was really the highlight of the film	cumberbach film ke mukhya akarshan tha
got good reviews rotten tomatoes rarely goes over it seems	acha sameekhan mila rotton tomatos ko ke uper sameekshan nahi mila
who is alan turing	alan turing kaun hai
true metacritic gave them turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the british during wwii against the germans he is famous for breaking the enigma code	sach hein yar metacritic ne diya tha turing toh mathematician hein jo british ke liye cryptanalyst bane the tab wwii saari germans ke against the aur voh enigma code ko break karne mein famous hein
he was outed as a spy by the police who were investigating a break in at his home	voh toh spy the aur police ke liye investigate kar rahe the jo unka ghar break hogaya tha
definitely see it if you get a chance	jarur dekh na agar aapko chance mila toh
dramas tend to kind of bore me usually with many note worthy exceptions i like comedies mostly or fantasy sci fi i will check it out though all in all i just love movies	voh drama toh bore lagne laga usme jyada note worthy exceptions tha muje comedies aur fantasy pasand aaya especially sci fi mein check kar lunga overall muje movies pasand hein
sounds like an interesting fellow will definetly give it a watch	lagtha hein interest se rahega jarur mein watch karunga
it is really more of an espionage movie it is pretty exciting i guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with morcom his mentor	han yar yeh toh espionage movie nikla bahut excite hein usme muje lagtha hein ki usme kuch drama apni boarding school ka experiences mein se likha hoga aur morcom mein padne se likha hoga jo uska mentor tha
morton tyldum is a great director	morton tyldum bahut badiya director hein
andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right if he liked it i will probably hate it	voh andrew grant aur uska rag science ka news kabhi bhi right nahi hota agar voh ushe pasand aaya tho mein use hate karunga
the hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of cumberpatch as i am	voh hollywood reporter toh cumberpatch nikhla jaisa mein hoon
cumberbach does a great job acting	kamal ki acting ki hai cumberbach ne
these storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion	mere opinion me true stories pe based ye story hamesha history ko distort karti hain use interesting banane ke liye
the bit about getting married to keira knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting i might warn you about all that	keira knightley se marriage ko lekar jo wakya hai wo thoda annoying hai agar aap uski acting ko leke thode favorable nahi hai to tumhe iske bare me warn kar raha hu
it is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life i see your point there	interesting baat ye hai ki yah movie us play par based hai jo uski life par likhi book par based hai tumhara point dekh sakta hu mai
i would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film the good acting and even the half made up story	mai probably film ke technical aspect ko enjoy karu badhiya acting aur half cooked story
i think also where it is a movie about a mathematician it kind of helps to add in some plot elements i think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting	i think also yah movie ek mathematician ke baare men hai plot me thode elements dalna helpful hai par mujhe ye unusual laga kyonki uski life to waise hi itni interesting hai
there is quite a bit of espionage involved as well i suppose i am not spoiling it since it is history but there is some russian collusion involved	isme espionage ka angle bhi involve hai i suppose mai kuch spoil nahi kar raha hu kyonki ye history hai but kuch russian secret bhi involved hai
if he marries keira knightly i may be shouting at my t v	agar wo keira knightly se marriage karega to mai shayad t v par hi shout karne lagu
big drama when turing confronts the russians	bada drama hua jab turning russians ko confront karta hai
she is trite absolutely but the director does make it work here	vah bilkul trait hai lekin nirdeshak ise yahaan kaam karate hain
also turns out he is gay	yah bhee pata chala ki vah samalaingik hai
so she gets what she deserves	isalie use vah milata hai jisaka vah hakadaar hai
you might actualy like it	aap ise pasand kar sakate hain
well that kinda of makes it more inviting to me keira nightly must be sad to find that out	khair yah thode ise aur adhik mere lie aamantrit karata hai keira naitalee ko yah pata lagaane ke lie dukhee hona chaahie
sounds a bit like beautiful mind that was a great movie too	sundar dimaag kee tarah lagata hai ki ek mahaan philm thee bhee
tuberculosis	tuberculosis
talk about changing the story	story badalne ke baare main batao
turing s story is pretty sad he got bullied a lot at boarding school seems to have affected him a lot too bad he wasn t able to find love maybe he should have gone for somebody besides kiera knightley	turing ki story bahut sad hai usko boarding school main bahut bully kia gaya lagta hai woh bahut affect hua too bad use love nahin mila maybe use kiera knightley ke alava kisi aur ko jaana chahiye tha
how come you dislike her so much	kaise tum use itna dislike kar sakte ho
mostly just for hogging that driftwood in titanic	mostly driftwood ke hogging ke liye titanic mein
oh yeah i have never seen that one	oh haan maine kabhi nahin dekha tha usko
haha that is funny i figured that but didn t want to say	ha bahut hi majedar hai hum ko malum tha ki bat karna nahi chahete
she is kind of a walking plattitude kind of like reese witherspoon but more indiana less texas	woh ladki chalne wali sadharan hai reese witherspoon ki tarah lekin jyada indiana aur kum texas
or something	ya kuch kuch
oh its ok im not blind however after looking at keira knightley for hours i might be	arey teek hai hum andha nahi hai lekin do ghante tak hum keira knightly ko dekhne ke badh ho sakta hai
still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told ill have to tune in	phir bhi is kahani aisa mahatwa lagta hai ki sabhi ko batana chahiye humko sunna padega
anyways she didn t ruin the movie if anything turing s life ruins the movie it s just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love he could have just worked out made some friends and been happy it is a very important story reminds me of the life of charles darwin or plato	vise bhi usne philam ko barbad nahi kiya turing ka jeevan film ko barbad kar deta hai bahut dukh ki bat hai ki voh tung agaya aur sam legik prem ka sharan leta hai woh kam kar sakta tha kuch dost bana sakta tha aur khush reha sakta tha yeh to ek bahut hi mahatpurna kahani hai charles darwin ya plato ka yad dilata hai
oh i really like reese not sure what that says about me	arre mujhe vastavme reez pasand hai lakin woh mere bare me kya bolta hai malum nahi hai
that is funny but you don t like kiera	yeh majak ki bat hai lekin apko kiera pasand nahi hai
fitness is very important im a big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story	fitness bahut jaruri hai mi darwin ka bada prasanshak hai jise mujhe kahani me aur dilchaspi huyi
well darwin had a rough time on the beagle he was the captain s special steward which was a demanding job if you know what i mean	कुंआ daarvin ko beegal par ek kathin samay tha vah kaptaan ke khaas steward tha jo ek maangalik kaary tha yadi tumhen maaloom hai ki mera kya matalab hai
all of the hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it	sabhee holeevud raigs isake baare mein bahut jyaada bolate the
his theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life he was certainly an interesting fellow	phitanes ka unaka siddhaant mool roop se kaptaan aur jeevan mein unake steshan ke lie unake rishte ka ek saadrshy tha aur apane jeevan mein ek uchch steshan ke lie vikaas kee usakee bhaavana vah nishchit roop se ek dilachasp saathee tha
no they have their own problems	nahin unakee apanee samasyaen nahin hain
and what do they know about science	aur ve vigyaan ke baare mein kya jaanate hain
not since they gave the big lebowski such awful reviews	nahin jab se unhonne da big lebovskee ko aisee bhayaanak sameeksha dee
turing is an important guy i d rather see a movie about kurt godel or giordano bruno	tyooring ek mahatvapoorn ladaka hai balki main kart godel ya jiyordaano broono ke baare mein ek philm dekhoonga
or maybe a serious horror drama about galileo	ya shaayad gaileeliyo ke baare mein ek gambheer horar naatak
i think the big lebowski was a great film i didn t realize it had a poor critical reception	mere vichar se big lebowski great film thi mujhe nahi maloom tha ki ise poor critical reception mila
i actually think i might write a script about the life of galileo	me actually sochta hu ki mujhe galileo ki life ke bare me ek script likhna chahiye
your right because scientifically the big lebowski is the best movie ever made yet magazines like empire and variety pee d on its rug	tum right ho kyunki scientifically big lebowski aaj tak banayi gayi best film he iske bawajood empire aur variety jaisi magazines iski apman janak alochna karti he
people would love that it would make them feel smart	people pasand karenge ki ye unhe smart feel karayega
actually that makes sense	actually ye mayne rakhta he
i am actually ordained as a dudist priest	me actually dudist priest ke rup me jana jata hu
you can do it online for free and then you can legally marry people	tum ise online free me kar sakte ho aur uske bad tum legally kisi se bhi marriage kar sakte ho

there is a fun facebook page too dudeism check it out	ek majedaar phesabuk pej bhee hai yaar yah jaanch
what is up with this study though i feel we are being watched do you think we will be in a movie with benjamin cumberbach	haalaanki is adhyayan ke saath kya ho raha hai mujhe lagata hai ki hamen dekha ja raha hai kya aapako lagata hai ki ham benjaamin kambarabaich ke saath ek philm mein honge
haha i use that term myface all the time	hah ki main har samay myfachai shabd ka upayog karata hoon
great minds think alike	bade man vaale aisa sochate hain
i once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstar s	mainne ek baar dankin bakestaar naamak ek kophee kee dukaan kholane ke vichaar ke saath khilavaad kiya
but yes they say iron knows iron	lekin haan ve kahate hain ki loha lohe ko jaanata hai
it said there would be three pages yet we seem to be done	isane kaha ki teen pej honge phir bhee ham aisa karate prateet hote hain
anyways though it is pretty exciting to see turing recalibrate that machine you will enjoy that	vaise bhee us masheen ko tyooring reekailibret dekhana kaaphee romaanchak hai aapako maja aaega

emma who plays mia writes her own one women play that sound interesting ryan who is playing sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together i am thinking they sound like a fun couple	emma jo mia ka role play kiya voh apni aap hi yek women ko play kiya voh toh bada interesting hey ryan jo sebastian ka role play kiya voh regularly yek club mein perform kar rahe they aur dono move kiya muje lagtha hein ki dono fun couple hein

no she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play her first play sounds like it was a bust	no wo mad thi aur usne use play ko miss karne ke liye forgive nahi kiya uska first play aisa laga jaise wo bust ho gaya ho
it sounds like it writing plays must be difficult sounds like she took it hard	aisa lagta hai ki wo accha hai play writing difficult hoga aisa lagta hai usne use hard liya hai
john legend plays keith he is a band member i bet hes a great bank member	john legend ne keith ka role play kiya wo ek band member hai me bet karta hun ki wo ek great bank member hai

the inception was given a rotten tomatoes rating of	the inception ko ka rotten tomatoes rating given he
i see leonardo dicaprio starred in it as well as joseph gordon levitt ellen page and tom hardy	me dekha leonardo dicaprio isme starred he as well as joseph gordon levitt ellen page aur tom hardy
is a fair rating i felt that this movie was excellent but somewhat heady i could see why it isn t everyone s cup of tea what rating would you give inception	fair rating he mujhe laga ki ye movie excellent he but somewhat heady he me dekh sakta hu ki kyu ye everyone ka cup of tea he tum inception ko kya rating dete
i agree seems fair	me agree hu fair lagti he
there were some interesting characters in this movie what character did you relate to most	is movie me kuch interesting character the kis character se tum sabse adhik relate karte ho
leonardo dicaprio was compelling in the role of dom the inception seems like a tailor fit role for dicaprio i enjoyed his performance but found that the plot was so inventive that i had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters it seemed too divorced from reality	leonardo dicaprio dom ke role me compelling tha the inception ka role lagta he ki dicaprio ke liye tailor fit role tha mene uska performance enjoy kiya but mujhe laga ki role itna inventive tha ki kis bhi character se directly relate karna mere liye hard he
well it was interesting to say the least the idea of planting something into another persons subconscious made me think for sure	well kam bolna interesting tha kisi dusre ke subconscious mein kuch plant karne ke idea nei mujhe sure kar diya
it was pretty out there	bahar bahut sunder h
i adore them the more out there the better	i unse pyar h bahar bahut better h
i did i loved it it was like a dreamy rube goldberg contraption	maine kiya yaha mujhe pasand h yaha dremy rube goldberg contraption ki tarah h
if the dreamer died and you end up in limbo where do you think that is all of the extractors are living within that consciousness what would become of them since if he dies that consciousness will cease to exist	agar dreamer mar gaya toh limbo mein end hotha kaise aise kar sakthe sabhi extractors issi consciousness mein hi jee rahe hein kya yeb sab ban baayenge
good question and very thought provoking in the movie they just went into limbo but i suppose the subconscious dreams would have to adjust to fit the new scenario it would be scary to have the possibility of forgetting that you are in a dream at all do you think it would be worth the potential setback	ache question kaafi provoking thought hein is movie mein voh limbo ke liye gaye hein kyon ki mein subconscious dream par is scenario ko nahi mil paatha bahut scary dream hein kya aap ko is potential setback ke baare mein kya haal chaal hein
good point what did you think about what happened to mal	ache point hein toh aap us mal ko kya huva
mal s conflict is pivotal to this film for all the layers of intrigue we have diving down into the dreams of the target mal s actions plant the idea in our minds that there could be many layers above as well is the reality we began this film in reality at all what do you think	mal ka conflick is film mein pivotal hein toh sabhi intrigue ko is dream ka target diving hota hein mals ka action plant ka idea toh badi layers hein reality mein toh is film thoda jyada hi reality ho gaya kya aap kya sochte hein
reality as we know it can be hard if there was an alternate reality available that was more enjoyable i could see where mal would want to believe it was the real reality the dreams would have to be extremely detailed and believable to be that convinced since mal committed suicide to attempt to wake up for real i assume the beginning reality was the real one do you think cobb should face murder charges for mal s death	hakikath mein toh jeena thoda kasth hein agar koi alternate reality hein toh maja aatha muje toh us mal ko reality mein believe hi nahi hota uska dream toh badi detailed aur believable thi ki koi convinced ho saktha agar mal suicide karne ka dream aatha jab utne se toh mein reality par believe karte kya cobb ko mals ka murder charges lagane ka faisla thik tha
absolutely not the audience knows the real truth	bilkul nahi yar audience ko sach patha hota hei
it s a good thing ariadne had the kick setup for fischer to wake up	yeh sabhi baath hein ki ariadne ko us fisher ne acha kick setup kiya jab wake up hote par

i would too would you stay in a dream forever if it were the reality you loved	mai bhi kya tum humesha k liye ek dream me rahoge agar tumhe reality pasand ho
it would certainly be tempting how odd would it be to know you are in a dream yet you are getting older living a whole life waking up you d be much younger then in the dream do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it is the actual reality	bohot tempting hoga wo tumhe kaisa lagega yeh jaan k ki bhale hi tum ek dream me ho par phir bhi tum age kar rahe aur ek life ji rahe jab jagoge toh tum bohot young hoge dream me tumhe lagta hai yeh yakeen karna mushkil hoga actual reality
well it depends i m growing older right now but i believe this is reality i d certainly be happy to die but then wake up a younger man but i have no difficulty believing this is reality because i don t know any better right now if i did know this was a dream i d be happy to stay here because i d get to live a whole extra life before my next what would you do	waise it depends mai abhi budha ho raha aur mujhe lagta hai yeh reality hai mujhe waise yeh sahi me accha lagega agar mai maru aur phir se zinda jab hou tab young ho jau waise mujhe yeh manne me koi pareshaani nahi ki yeh sacchai hai kuiki mujhe isse better kuch pata nahi hai agar yeh ek sapna hai toh mai yaha rehna chachunga kyuki jab mai jagunga toh mujhe ek extra life jeene ko milegi tum kya sochate ho
what did you think of the spinning top totem	tum kya sochate ho spinning top totem k baare me
what kind of totem do you think you would have	tum kis type ka totem pasand karoge

you know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies	tum jaante ho to be honest agar duniya ko aise dekhoge jaise abhi hai to unka dushman hona makes perfect sense
i guess so they do have polar opposite personalities one is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive	i guess so unki bilkul polar opposite personalities hai ek to humble farm boy hai dusra ek rich executive
it says in the rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman	aisa bolte hai ke rd part me superman ke funeral k dauran bruce lois lane se maafi mangta hai ye bolte hue k he failed superman

it s a sci fi movie and i don t typically watch those	yah sci fi moivehai mai eashi movi pasand nahi karta
not sure it s that good it has a score of on rotten tomatoes	sayad utni achi na ho rottten tomatoes ne ieshe score diye hai
that s what i was thinking also	mai bhi yahi soch ta hu
actually i kind of like sci fi but i m picky	vaise mai sci fi pasand karta hu lakin mai picky hu
yes i can agree with that it depends for me	mai isse agree kar sakta hu yah mujh par bhi depend karta hai
this one sounds more like an action flick in a sci fi setting	ish moive ki sound like action flick jaise hai
ah that would make sense	wah ye yek bat hai
it also has sports	yeh sports ka hein
i thought more sci fi because it was also a twilight zone episode	scifi ka kyon ki isme twilight zone ka episode bhi hein
but the rocky with robots line makes me doubt that i would like it	lekin rocky with robots tho muje doubt hein
i ve never seen any rocky s either	rocky tho mein kahi dekha nahi hein
and i didn t know it was a twilight zone episode	aur muje twilight zone episode ke baare mein tho kuch patha nahi hein
that s kind of odd to me i feel like most everyone has seen them	kuch off hein mere liye kyon ki agar koi kuch aise puche
the premise of this one is not so stupid though robot boxers i feel it could become real at some point	iska premise bhi itna stupid bhi nahi hein robot tho boxers hein muje tho real ke tarah feel huva us point mein
rocky yeah i know it was such a big movie	rocky haan muje patha hein kitna big movie hein
but stallone has never done anything for me	but stallone ne mere liye kuch nahi kiya
this real steel movie has hugh jackman in it he s not b ad	real steel movie mei hugh jackman hai vah bura nahi hai

haha we re thinking the same thing	hahaha ham sab ek hee baat ke bare mei soch rahe hai
exactly he looks like he has quite a few more iq points than sylvester	rahi hai vo dikha raha hai ki vah shaant hai kuch iq points mei s sylvester
and he s better looking haha	par vash achcha dikha raha hai
not difficult	difficult nahi hai
we re losing track of real steel though	ham real steel ke track ko lose kar rahe hai
the whole real steel story seems like a series of machinations of bad guys against good guys without much else	real steel ka story tho series of machination us bad guys jo good guys se agains hein
same here this one sounds like it s been writ ten by committee	same yar kuch commitee ke tarah sounds kartha
right i do like that it s a a family movie i don t have kids but i feel like it would be ok for my nephew	right muje bhi family movie dekhna pasand hein muje kids nahi hein lekin mein apni nephew ke saath dekhtha

the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movie s world	jo paragraph load hu usne mujhe remind karaya ki ki ye kitna interesting factor tha movie me ki ye robots us movie world me everyday object the
like he s just a lower class dude but he owns a fighting robot	like wo just ek lower class dude tha but wo ek fighting robot own karta hai
yeah seeing the draw of their world and how these robots are just sort of common was something that i really liked as well	yes unki duniya ka atmosphere dekh ke ki kaise ye robots just common thing hai yah sach me wo factor tha jo mujhe bhi bahut pasand aaya
i thought about what it would be like to really live in that world	i thought about ki really us world me rahne me kaisa lagta hoga
also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesn t make all problems go away	also ye bhi interesting point tha ki kaise sirf improved technology is duniya ki saari problems ko whisk away nahi kar sakti

it s just the classic underdog story told in a somewhat different way there will always be trials and triumphs	yeh tho classic underdog story jo different way mein kaha gaya hein trials aur triumphs tho aathe jaathe hein
as long as humans are around we ll never really intrinsically change	jab tak humans aapas mein aathe tab tak hum kabhi intrinsically change nahi karte
nothing intrinsic is lost	intrinsic tho kuch nahi hein
right i suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans more so than the actual humans that s a really interesting concept i think	sahi hei kahi log tho robots ko human ke tarah dekhne lagthe lekin actual humans tho behetar hein really interesting concept hein yar
kinda reminds me of virtual reality	virtual reality ka yaad aaya
humanity lives on but through the robots	humanity tho jinda rahega lekin robots

have you seen this movie	aap movie dekha hai
i just saw it	ha maine abi kuch der pahale dekha hoon
have you seen it	aap dekha hai
no i usually like stuff with benedict cumberpatch though	nahi main benedict cumberpatch jaise movie dekhtha hoon
it was such a thrilling movie based on the life of alan turing	woh bada romanchakari movie tha woh alan turing ke jeevan ke bare me tha
keira knightly slightly annoys me however	keira knightly mujeh achi nahi lagtha
cumberbach was really the highlight of the film	cumberbach film ke mukhya akarshan tha
got good reviews rotten tomatoes rarely goes over it seems	acha sameekhan mila rotton tomatos ko ke uper sameekshan nahi mila
who is alan turing	alan turing kaun hai
true metacritic gave them turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the british during wwii against the germans he is famous for breaking the enigma code	sach hein yar metacritic ne diya tha turing toh mathematician hein jo british ke liye cryptanalyst bane the tab wwii saari germans ke against the aur voh enigma code ko break karne mein famous hein
he was outed as a spy by the police who were investigating a break in at his home	voh toh spy the aur police ke liye investigate kar rahe the jo unka ghar break hogaya tha
definitely see it if you get a chance	jarur dekh na agar aapko chance mila toh
dramas tend to kind of bore me usually with many note worthy exceptions i like comedies mostly or fantasy sci fi i will check it out though all in all i just love movies	voh drama toh bore lagne laga usme jyada note worthy exceptions tha muje comedies aur fantasy pasand aaya especially sci fi mein check kar lunga overall muje movies pasand hein
sounds like an interesting fellow will definetly give it a watch	lagtha hein interest se rahega jarur mein watch karunga
it is really more of an espionage movie it is pretty exciting i guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with morcom his mentor	han yar yeh toh espionage movie nikla bahut excite hein usme muje lagtha hein ki usme kuch drama apni boarding school ka experiences mein se likha hoga aur morcom mein padne se likha hoga jo uska mentor tha
morton tyldum is a great director	morton tyldum bahut badiya director hein
andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right if he liked it i will probably hate it	voh andrew grant aur uska rag science ka news kabhi bhi right nahi hota agar voh ushe pasand aaya tho mein use hate karunga
the hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of cumberpatch as i am	voh hollywood reporter toh cumberpatch nikhla jaisa mein hoon
cumberbach does a great job acting	kamal ki acting ki hai cumberbach ne
these storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion	mere opinion me true stories pe based ye story hamesha history ko distort karti hain use interesting banane ke liye
the bit about getting married to keira knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting i might warn you about all that	keira knightley se marriage ko lekar jo wakya hai wo thoda annoying hai agar aap uski acting ko leke thode favorable nahi hai to tumhe iske bare me warn kar raha hu
it is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life i see your point there	interesting baat ye hai ki yah movie us play par based hai jo uski life par likhi book par based hai tumhara point dekh sakta hu mai
i would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film the good acting and even the half made up story	mai probably film ke technical aspect ko enjoy karu badhiya acting aur half cooked story
i think also where it is a movie about a mathematician it kind of helps to add in some plot elements i think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting	i think also yah movie ek mathematician ke baare men hai plot me thode elements dalna helpful hai par mujhe ye unusual laga kyonki uski life to waise hi itni interesting hai
there is quite a bit of espionage involved as well i suppose i am not spoiling it since it is history but there is some russian collusion involved	isme espionage ka angle bhi involve hai i suppose mai kuch spoil nahi kar raha hu kyonki ye history hai but kuch russian secret bhi involved hai
if he marries keira knightly i may be shouting at my t v	agar wo keira knightly se marriage karega to mai shayad t v par hi shout karne lagu
big drama when turing confronts the russians	bada drama hua jab turning russians ko confront karta hai
she is trite absolutely but the director does make it work here	vah bilkul trait hai lekin nirdeshak ise yahaan kaam karate hain
also turns out he is gay	yah bhee pata chala ki vah samalaingik hai
so she gets what she deserves	isalie use vah milata hai jisaka vah hakadaar hai
you might actualy like it	aap ise pasand kar sakate hain
well that kinda of makes it more inviting to me keira nightly must be sad to find that out	khair yah thode ise aur adhik mere lie aamantrit karata hai keira naitalee ko yah pata lagaane ke lie dukhee hona chaahie
sounds a bit like beautiful mind that was a great movie too	sundar dimaag kee tarah lagata hai ki ek mahaan philm thee bhee
tuberculosis	tuberculosis
talk about changing the story	story badalne ke baare main batao
turing s story is pretty sad he got bullied a lot at boarding school seems to have affected him a lot too bad he wasn t able to find love maybe he should have gone for somebody besides kiera knightley	turing ki story bahut sad hai usko boarding school main bahut bully kia gaya lagta hai woh bahut affect hua too bad use love nahin mila maybe use kiera knightley ke alava kisi aur ko jaana chahiye tha
how come you dislike her so much	kaise tum use itna dislike kar sakte ho
mostly just for hogging that driftwood in titanic	mostly driftwood ke hogging ke liye titanic mein
oh yeah i have never seen that one	oh haan maine kabhi nahin dekha tha usko
haha that is funny i figured that but didn t want to say	ha bahut hi majedar hai hum ko malum tha ki bat karna nahi chahete
she is kind of a walking plattitude kind of like reese witherspoon but more indiana less texas	woh ladki chalne wali sadharan hai reese witherspoon ki tarah lekin jyada indiana aur kum texas
or something	ya kuch kuch
oh its ok im not blind however after looking at keira knightley for hours i might be	arey teek hai hum andha nahi hai lekin do ghante tak hum keira knightly ko dekhne ke badh ho sakta hai
still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told ill have to tune in	phir bhi is kahani aisa mahatwa lagta hai ki sabhi ko batana chahiye humko sunna padega
anyways she didn t ruin the movie if anything turing s life ruins the movie it s just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love he could have just worked out made some friends and been happy it is a very important story reminds me of the life of charles darwin or plato	vise bhi usne philam ko barbad nahi kiya turing ka jeevan film ko barbad kar deta hai bahut dukh ki bat hai ki voh tung agaya aur sam legik prem ka sharan leta hai woh kam kar sakta tha kuch dost bana sakta tha aur khush reha sakta tha yeh to ek bahut hi mahatpurna kahani hai charles darwin ya plato ka yad dilata hai
oh i really like reese not sure what that says about me	arre mujhe vastavme reez pasand hai lakin woh mere bare me kya bolta hai malum nahi hai
that is funny but you don t like kiera	yeh majak ki bat hai lekin apko kiera pasand nahi hai
fitness is very important im a big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story	fitness bahut jaruri hai mi darwin ka bada prasanshak hai jise mujhe kahani me aur dilchaspi huyi
well darwin had a rough time on the beagle he was the captain s special steward which was a demanding job if you know what i mean	badiya darwin ka bura time tha beagle par wo captain ka special steward tha jo ki ek demanding job thi agar tum jante ho ki mera kya matlab he
all of the hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it	hollywood ke sare newspaper uski badi badi karte dikhai dete hain
his theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life he was certainly an interesting fellow	uski theory darasal ek analogy thi uski captain and station ke life ke liye or uski apni life main evolution to a higher station ke feeling ke liye wo waqai ek interesting admi tha
i seriously loved this turing movie you have to see it	seriously mujhe turing movie pasand ayi tumhain dekhni hogi
i dont usually take anything the hollywood reporter says to heart though	halanki main dil par nahin leta jobhi hollywood ke reporter ne kaha
no they have their own problems	nahin unki apni problems hain
and what do they know about science	or wo science ke bare main kya jante hain
not since they gave the big lebowski such awful reviews	jabse unhone the big lebowski jese awful reviews tabse nahin
turing is an important guy i d rather see a movie about kurt godel or giordano bruno	turing ek important admi he main iske bajae kurl godel ya giordano bruno ki movie dekhunga
or maybe a serious horror drama about galileo	or shayad galileo ke bare main serious horror drama
i think the big lebowski was a great film i didn t realize it had a poor critical reception	mere vichar se big lebowski great film thi mujhe nahi maloom tha ki ise poor critical reception mila
i actually think i might write a script about the life of galileo	me actually sochta hu ki mujhe galileo ki life ke bare me ek script likhna chahiye
your right because scientifically the big lebowski is the best movie ever made yet magazines like empire and variety pee d on its rug	tum right ho kyunki scientifically big lebowski aaj tak banayi gayi best film he iske bawajood empire aur variety jaisi magazines iski apman janak alochna karti he
people would love that it would make them feel smart	people pasand karenge ki ye unhe smart feel karayega
actually that makes sense	actually ye mayne rakhta he
i am actually ordained as a dudist priest	me actually dudist priest ke rup me jana jata hu

hi have you seen the movie the imitation game	namaste kya aapane philm da imiteshan gem dekhee hai
i haven t what s that about	mainne nahin kiya hai yah kis baare mein hai
it s a american historical drama about real life cryptoanalyst alan turing	yah vaastavik jeevan kee kriptokaransee elan tyooring ke baare mein ka amerikee aitihaasik naatak hai
it sounds interesting what does alan turing do	yah dilachasp lagata hai elan tyooring kya karata hai
he decrypted german intelligence codes for the british government during wwii	unhonne wwii ke dauraan british sarakaar ke lie jarman intelijens kod ko dikript kiya
it has rating on rotten tomatoes and average and a metacritic score of what ratings does a movie have to have for you to watch it or do you not consider ratings when deciding to watcha movie	roten tomaatoz par isakee reting aur ausat aur ka metaakritik skor hai philm ko dekhane ke lie aapake paas kya reting hai ya kya aap vaatsep philm ka phaisala karate samay reting par vichaar nahin karate hain
are you there	tum vaha the
yes sorry for the delay i did see the movi e recently i don t usually enjoy political films but i thought it was quite well done	ha maf karna maine abhi vah moive dekhi vaise me political base moive pasand nahi karta but ye kafi achhi thi
no worries oh yeah i thought meryl streep and tom hanks were both pretty good	koi nahi oh muje lagta hai maeryl steep aur tom hanks dono briya hai
so it apparently has a rotten tomatoes rating of which surprises me because like you said most people don t seem to go for political thrillers	jaise rotten tomatoes ne ise ki rating di mai surprised hu kayoki jayda log political thrillers nahi dekte
i m looking to see who sarah paulson played i saw it too	mai dekhna chahuga sarah paulson kaun play karta hai mai bhi
oh she was tony	acha tho tony hein voh
it s described as an american historical thriller which i guess i agree with given the nature of the pentagon papers	american historical thriller se described kiya hein jo muje guess ki voh nature ka pentagon papers diya hoga
matthew rhys was in it too i like him as an actor	matthew rhys bhi they muje unhe pasand hein
critics seemed to be torn about the movie	is movie mein tho torn hi behetar critics se saath
one said the post passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama	yek kaha ki is post tho trickiest test passe huva hei is historical drama mein
another said is too calculated to reflect today s ragged tenuous sociopolitical climate	dusra kaha ki aajkal ka ragged tho thoda reflect hein calculate karne pe tenuous sociopolitical climate
who was your favorite actor in the movie	tumhara manpasand hero kon hai movie main
meryl streep for sure being the first female publisher of a major news source it was really amazing to see her part in the struggle and how it was unique to that role	meril streep ke lie sunishchit karen ek pramukh samaachaar srot kee pahalee mahila prakaashak hone ke naate sangharsh mein apane hisse ko dekhana vaastav mein aashcharyajanak tha aur us bhoomika ke lie yah kaise adviteey tha
yeah there were some moments in the movie for sure	hnji movie main kuch moment jaroor honge
what did you think of tom hanks performance in the movie	tumhe tom hanks ka movie main kaam kaisa lga
i thought it was really good he does really well at things set more in the past like the s in this one	socha ki yah vaastav mein achchha tha vah vaastav mein achchhee tarah se ateet mein set kee gaee cheejon ko achchhee tarah se karata hai jaise ki is ke dashak mein। show less
o r rather did you catch why i feel like i must have missed something	o aar balki tumane pakada kyon mujhe aisa lag raha hai ki mujhe kuchh yaad aa gaya hoga
no i think he was just disenchanted with the war and how we had escalated our involvement	nahin mujhe lagata hai ki vah yuddh se vimukh tha aur hamane apanee bhaageedaaree ko kaise badhaaya tha
apparently ellsberg overheard robert mcnamara saying he thought the war was hopeless even though he was telling the public it was going well and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth	ellsberg tho robert mcnamara se bol raha tha ki yeh war hopeless hein even though voh voh public ke saath bole ki yeh ache jaayega aur voh disillusioned ban gaye aur truth leak karne ke decide kiya
that was a plot detail i definitely missed must have been an early scene in the movie	voh plot detail tho mein definitely missed karunga is movie mein early scene honge
oh you re right i forgot that he had overheard that conversation i m glad tom hank s character was able to figure out it was he who had leaked the info and got all of the information he needed for the post	oh tho sahi hein muje tho bhool hi gaya ki voh overheard hein is conversation mein muje khus hein ki tom hank s ka character figure out kar sakthe aur info ko leaked huva aur saari info jo unhe post karne ko soch
here is a question for you would you recommend this movie to people you know who haven t seen it	aap ke liye yek question kya aap is movie ko recommend karenge
i would recommend it for sure to most people despite it taking place int he s i feel spielberg took it in a really exciting direction instead of just throwing facts at you about the case	mai isse jayada logo ko recommand karta hu bavjud he place muje lagta hai spoelberg exciting hai
i think it was filmed well and i was surprised how much suspense built even though i already knew the basic facts	yah ek achi film thi mai surprised hu itne jayada suspense the jabki mai sare fact janta ta
there were so many details i had no idea about and i like how it sort of set the stage for the watergate scandal right afterwards with nixon	isme itne sare detail the muje idea nahi tha aur muje pasant aya watergate scandal nixon ke saath
i completely forgot about that scene at the end just got some details for the movie summary and it mentions that i guess that was one year later	mai ant ka seen bilkul bhul gayamoive ki summary milne par laga yah yek saal bad
what did you think of the part when the case went to the supreme court	jab case superme court me tha us part ke bare me kya socha
it looks like we re all done here thanks for chatting	ise laga jaise hum hi bat kar rahe ho
i don t remember much about the lawyer i just liked how the other newspapers picke dup the mantle to support the post and times	mai lawyer ke bare jayda nahi socha maine keval yah socha dusre paper kasi support kare
oh yeah thanks	oh ha thanks
hello	namaste
hey what s up	hey kya ho raha hai
have you watched la la land before	tumne pehle la la land dekhi hai
yes i really appreciated how much thought went into the movie s title i think it s really cool how it refers to los angeles music and having your head in the clouds all at once it s really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title	han mein sach mein iss baat ki kadra karta hu ki iss film k title mein kitni soch lagayi hai mein sochta hu ki ye bohat cool hai ki ye film los angeles snageet aur apne sir badalon mein hone ka jikra ek sath karti hai yah bohat shandar hai ki unhone itne sare tatvon ko ek sath shamil kar lia film k itne chhote title mein
yep i watched it because critics seemed to like it	han meine usse dekha hai kyuki wah aalochakon ko achhi lagi
yes i especially agree with the review that la la land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream	han mein uss review se khaaskar sehmat hu jismein kaha hai ki la la land sapno k peeche bhaagne par aaney wali pareshaniyon ko dikhane mein safal huyi
yep i agree with you i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack since they re not singers	yep mein aapse agree hu mujhe believe hai humko emma stone and ryan gosling kuch slack hai kyuki woh singers nahi hai
it was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after i watched the movie	yeh un scenes mein se ek hai jo movie dekhne ke baad mere se stuck ho gaye
would you do that if you were in his position	aap yesa karte if aap uski position mein hote
i m not sure i liked how that was when mia first heard sebastian sing and was truly moved by it i think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship	i m not sure mujhe accha laga jab mia ne pheli baar sebastian ka gana suna aur kaise woh truly moved ho gayi i think yeh unka relationship start karne ka interesting way hai
yeah it was just sad how he brushed her off since things could ve been different	yeah yeh sad hai usne kaise brush kiya kyuki things different ho sakti thi
do you usually watch musicals	tum usually musicals dekhte ho
occasionally i also enjoyed the development of sebastian and mia s relationship such as when mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because sebastian suggests it to her i feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship	occasionally mujhe sbesatian aur mia ke relationship ka development accha laga jaise mia se decide kiya apne aap se play write karne ka kyuki sebastian ne usko suggest kiya mujhe yesa feel hua dono jab grow hue jab wo relationship mein aaye
i enjoyed that part too since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams	maine bhi wo part enjoy kiya isme ye bhi dikhaya gaya hai kaise dono mehnat karte hai apne dreams achieve karne
they both want to become successful in their separate areas but they have to struggle a lot	dono apne separate areas mein kamiyaab hona chahte hai lekin unhe bahut struggle karna hai
right i feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that s involved in following your dreams really sums it up the film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big	sahi mujhe lagta hai review jisme zulm ka zikar hai tumhaare khawaab puray karne wo bahut acha sum up kiya hai film darti nahi hai ye dikhaane ke kitne mehnat aur hardship lagti hai kuch bada karne
i mean he gets paid but it s not something he wants to do this happens in life a lot	mera matlab hai usko pay mila lekin wo ye nahi karna chahta life mein aisa bahut hota hai
what did you think of the scene when mia and sebastian get into a fight about mia thinking sebastian is giving up on his dreams	us scene ke baare mein aap ka kya khayal hai jub mia aur sebastian ka jhagda hota hai aur mia samajhti hai sebastian is giving up on his dreams
but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful	lekin shayad sebastian harsh tha jub usne kaha ke mia uskozyada pasand karti thi jub wo unsuccessful tha
it truly was heartbreaking when mia moved back home to nevada	sach mein bahut heartbreaking tha jub mia wapis apne ghar nevada chale jaati hai
it really was sad	wo sach mein sad tha
if so i was completely fooled	agar aisa hai to i was fooled
but i really was surprised that someone reviewed sebastian as a jazz snob because i did not get that vibe at all	lekin main bohat surprised tha ki kisine sebastaian ko jazz snob review kia kyunki mujhe aisi vibe nahi aati
yeah i disagreed with that characterization but i can see why someone might say that	han mujhe bhi disagree hua is characterization se lekin main samajh sakta hun kisine aisa kyun kaha hoga
he is a purist or whatever they called it in the film	wo ek purist hai ya fir jo be usey movie mein bulaya gaya
yes i thought her character was pretty nuanced but i m not sure it being courageous of her to move back to nevada after the play didn t go well i think that was her only option	han mujhe laga uska character kafi nuanced tha lekin main sure nahi hun ki kya nevada wpas jaana courageous tha play kharab jaane ke baad mujhe lagta hai uske paas sirf yahi option tha
about it	uske baare me
i suppose you have a point i just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn t cling on to sebastian when things didn t work out for her	aapke pas point hai mujhe lagta hai wo films mein portray ki jaane wali average woman se zyada independent thu kyunki jab uska kaam sahi nahi bana to usne sebastian ko cling nahi kia
although i wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams	lekin main chahta tha ki wo apne dreams achieve karne se pehle reconcile ho jaate
the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad	end me jo dikhaya tha wah mujhe actually kafi sad kar sakta tha
i agree it was very sad but also as one reviewer puts it quite bittersweet i wasn t sure how to feel at the end	i agree ki wah bhi bahut sad tha jaise ek reviewer ne kaha hai yah kafi bittersweet hai mai sure nahi tha ki end mai kaisa feel karu
it was nice discussing the film with you have a great day	tumhare sath film discuss karna nice tha have a great day
you guys have a pretty good ai system	tum logo ke pass kafi badhiya ai system hai
i was actually completely fooled	mai actually complete fool ban gaya tha
hi there	hi
it s a pretty great idea i m sure it s not one of the greatest movies ever made but he is really funny and so is morgan freeman	yeh tho badiya idea hein muje nahi lagtha ki yeh unka greatest movies mein yek hein kyon ki voh itna funny hein jaise morgan freeman ke tarah
jennifer aniston annoys me a little though i got ta say	jeenifer aniston tho muje bahut annoys karti aur mein bolne hi vaali thi
i look at rotten tomatoes a lot for movie ratings though and is pretty low it has been out for a while though	haanlanki main rotton tomatoes ko dekhta huin movie ratings check krne ke liye aur bahut kam hai haanlanki ye bahut dair se bahar hai
yes it has been out for quite some time maybe it s on netflix	han kafi samay se bahar hai shayad ye netflix pe bhi hai
my favorite movie genre is science fiction but i do like a good comedy or a good drama if it s a good movie i really don t care what genre it is	meri favorite movie genre hai science fiction but mujhe acchi comedy bhi acchi lagti hai ya achha drama agar ye ek acchi movie hai to main asal mein parwaah nhi krti ki ye kis genre ki hai
that s true the first review under the critical response section is pretty harsh i m not sure i really ever read or care about movie reviews just the ratings online	yeh sahi hai critical response section ka pehla review bahut harsh hai main sure nhi huin main movie reviews padhne ya itni parwaah nhi krta sirf online ratings
when looking at movie reviews i put more faith in actual regular people that go see the movie then i do official critics	jab movie reviews dekhte main faith official critics se zyada asal regular logo pe dekhta huin jo movie dekh kar aaye hain
true looking at the key scenes i feel like the plot might have been a little paint by numbers and relying on jim carrey s personality too much which is probably why it wasn t better recieved	sahi key scenes ko dekhte hai to mujhe lagta hai ki plot thoda paint by numbers aur jim carrey ki personality pe bahut zyada nirbhar hai shayad issi wajah hai ki better nhi mila
yes i can i didn t get that impression	han main kar skta huin mujhe achha impression nhi mila
sorry this is supposed to say that i did get that impression	sorry ye kahana chahiye ki mujhe vah aabhas mila
yes he is pretty good in everything he does	ha vah apane har kaam mein bahut achchhe hai
i haven t even heard of metacritic or cinemascore to be honest but it s weird that it s on metacritic and and a on cinemascore those are pretty different scores	maine bhi metacritic ya cinemascore pramanik hone ke bare mein nahin suna hai lekin yah ajib hai ki yah metacritic par hai aur cinemascore pe a hai yah bahut alag scores hain
that s true i m not sure how they score these things	yah sach hai mujhe yakin nahin hai ki ve in chijo ko kaise score karte hai
the part where he creates the email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto reply yes is pretty funny and says a lot about religion	vah hissa jaha vah prarthanao ka javab dene ke liye email system banata hai aur ise auto reply haa ke liye set karata hai vah bahut hi majedar hai aur dhharm ke bare me bahut kuchh kahata hai
sounds pretty funny i will have to put it on my list	bahut majedar lagata hai mujhe ise apane list mein rakhana hoga
for sure	for sure
interesting i mean the way the rest of the plot wraps up seems pretty standard	interesting i mean baaki jaise plot wrap up hote hai kaafi standard lagta hai
i agree however it might be worth a watch	i agree but ek time watch worth ho sakti hai
the best part of the movie is probably the middle section where he s testing out all of his powers seems like the end might be disappointing based on this description	movie ka best part probably middle section hai jaha wo apni sari power test karta hai aisa lagta hai k end description k basis pe disappointing ho sakta hai
hi	hi
lol i cant wait for the second movie of frozen to release	lol mein second movie ke release wait nahi kar sakti

hi	hi
hello	hello
the movie that was picked i	movie jo chuni gayi i
i ve never seen	maine kabhi nahi dekhi
hello what s the name of the movie	hello movie ka nam kay hai
hi it s the imitation game	hi wo the imitation game hai
does it seem interesting	kay wo interesting lag rahi hai
definitely it takes place during wwii and it s decrypting spy code messages	jaroor ye sab during wwii huva tha or it s decrypting spy code messages
cool is there a main lead actor or actress that s easily identifiable	cool kay us me main leaf actor or actress easily identifiable hai
yes it stars benedict cumberbatch and keira knightly it s got a pretty good score on rotten tomatoes and cinemascore	ha iss me benedict cumberbatch and keira knightly hai is co accha score mila hai tomatoes and cinemascore pe
good to know what studio is it produced by	good to know kis studio ne isse produce kiya hai
i m not sure about that but did you know there was an earlier movie about the same book	muze nahi pata uske bareme per tum ko pata hai kay there was an earlier movie about the same book
so it s based on a book	to ye kitap be based hai
yes it s based on alan turing the enigma and the earlier movie was called breaking the code it was on bbc	yes ye based hai alan turing the enigma or pehele ki movie ka nam tha breaking the code wo bbc pe thi
good to know although i didn t ask does it say who starred in the bbc version	jaanakaar achchha laga haalaanki mainne poochha nahin kya yah kahana hai ki bbc sanskaran mein kisane abhinay kiya
no but i ve got info on a few of the key scenes if you re interested in knowing	nahin lekin mujhe kuchh pramukh drshyon kee jaanakaaree milee hai yadi aap jaanane mein ruchi rakhate hain
absolutely are the scenes taken from the book the bbc version or the movie	poorn roop se pustak se lie gae drshy hain bbc sanskaran ya philm
from the movie with cumberbatch and knightley the earliest scene has turing in boarding school being bullied and he makes a friend there that gets him interested in cryptography	kee philm se kambarabaich aur naitalee ke saath shuruaatee drshy mein tyooring in bording skool ko badanaam kiya ja raha hai aur vah vahaan ek dost banaata hai jo use kriptograaphee mein dilachaspee leta hai
that s cool so it s sort of a biographical movie	yah achchha hai to yah ek jeevanee philm kee tarah hai
the next scene is when britain declares war on germany turing goes to work at a place called bletchley park that is trying to decode the nazi s enigma machine yes it s a historical drama	agala drshy hai jab briten ne jarmanee par yuddh kee ghoshana kee tyooring ek jagah par kaam karane jaata hai jise bailechale paark kaha jaata hai vah naajee kee pahelee masheen ko dikod karane kee koshish kar raha hai haan yah ek aitihaasik naatak hai
oh one of the critics says it rearranges the time sequences and invents fictional characters	oh ek aalochak kahata hai yah samay drshyon ko punarvyavasthit karata hai aur kaalpanik paatron ko laagoo karata hai
thanks for the clarification are there any more excerpts	spashteekaran ke lie dhanyavaad kya koee aur ansh hain
interesting does it mention how it s resolved or does it leave you sort of on the cliff	dilachasp hai yah ullekh karata hai ki yah kaise hal ho gaya hai ya kya yah aapako chattaan par chhodata hai
it kind of leaves a cliffhanger there there are a couple of twists though	yah vahaan ek kliphanar ko chhod deta hai haalaanki kuchh jode hain
it doesn t tell one of the twists in the plot is that a russian spy is discovered by turing which isn t surprising at first but then we find out that british intelligence planted him to tell the russians secrets they wanted them to know after all russia and great britain were on the same side in wwii	yah nahin bataata saajish mein ek tvist yah hai ki tyooring dvaara ek roosee jaasoos kee khoj kee jaatee hai yah pahalee baar mein aashcharyachakit karane vaala nahin hai lekin phir hamen pata chala ki british khuphiya ne unhen roos ke rahasyon ko bataane ke lie lagaaya tha jo ve jaanana chaahate the aakhirakaar roos aur gret briten wwii mein ek hee taraph the
that s sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation but whatever anything else super useful or interesting it sounds like a great movie	yah raajaneetik sthiti ke ek mod kee tarah hai lekin jo kuchh bhee supar upayogee ya dilachasp hai yah ek mahaan philm kee tarah lagata hai
when i watched the movie i liked the codebreaking machine they had it was this massive technical looking wall that was way before the time of wwii yes there s another twist in the plot where the russian spy threatens to tell everyone that turing is homosexual	jab mainne philm dekhee to mujhe unake paas kodabreking masheen pasand aaee yah is vishaal takaneekee dikhane vaalee deevaar thee jo wwii ke samay se pahale thee haan saajish mein ek aur mod hai jahaan roosee jaasoos ne sabhee ko yah bataane kee dhamakee dee ki tyooring samalaingik hai
how did the spy know that turing was gay	jaasoos ko kaise pata chala ki tyooring samalaingik tha
turing told the spy because turing was about to get married to clarke knightley it sounds like high drama to me the spy before turing realized he was a spy told turing to keep his homosexuality a secret i guess they were pretty tight	tyooring ne jaasoos ko bataaya kyonki tyooring kee shaadee klaark naitalee se hone vaalee thee yah mujhe uchch naatak kee tarah lagata hai jaasoos tyooring se pahale ehasaas hua ki vah ek jaasoos tha ne tyooring ko apanee samalaingikata ko gupt rakhane ke lie kaha tha mujhe lagata hai ki ve bahut tang the

ben affleck is the only actor i recognize great plot very harsh critcs	ben affleck hi sirf ek aisa actor hai jise main pehnchanta huin achha plot bhut harsh critics
i agree i didn t completely understand why batman and superman fought though	i agree mujhe theek se samajh nahi aaya ki batman and superman kyun lad rahe the
rotten tomatoes list it as and average with a out of the critcs must be weird yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad	rotten tomatoes par hai and average hai mein se critics bahut ajeeb hain mujhe fight samajh nahi aayi par mujhe lagta hai ki superman ne galti se bruce wayne ke dad ko maar diya tha
then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to mark zuckerburg	aur fir voh pagalon jaise usko mark zuckerburg se compare karne laga
ohh i liked that too i like how they always try to biring in the government official s	ohh voh mujhe bhi accha laga mujhe accha laga ki they always bring in government officials

it is its not what i expected at all	it is ye to mene bilkul bhi expect nahi kiya tha
i expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together	iske bajay me to avenger ki try expect kar raha tha where heroes ka bunch together work karta he
especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman	especially us point par jahan batman superman ko kill karne ja raha tha
duuhhhh well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol	duuhhhh well haan agar usne usey maar diya to he failed him
haha	haha

yeah though i was really disappointed with sulley for cheating	han halaki mai bohot niraash tha sulley ke cheating karne se
i was too that broke my heart i cried when that happened	mai bhi tha usne mera dil tod diya mai roya jab wo hua
for sully to trick mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful	sully nei mike ko trick kar rahi thi ki voh scary hein jo bahut hurt ful hein
and it explains why they re always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie they were once in that same position	aur voh explain karthe ki kyon voh janitors ke saath ache hein in original movie mein sab sam position mein they
oh my gosh i didn t even realize that i have to rewatch the movie you re totally right	omg muje realize hi nahi huva mein dubara dekhna pasand karungi
it does show a really good message for kids to be respectful of everybody	kids ke liye tho ache message hein kitna respectful hein voh sabke saath
it s a valuable message be kind and respectful to everyone don t expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life just be prepared to work your hardest	valuable message hei sabhi ke liye tho kind aur respectful hein credentials aur family reputation ke liye tho kabhi lean mat karo kaam hardest ke liye sirf ache se prepare karo
maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition because he didn t really realize the consequences of his actions just did what he thought was right	maybe yeh uska spoiled background ke vaje bhi ho saktha jo competition ke liye cheat kiya hein kyonki voh actions ke consequences ko realize hi nahi hota
and you have a good point there about kids needing that message	aur aap sahi hein aaj kal ka kids ko kaafi message need hein

i see that sounds pretty interesting though i do dragons are usually the bad guys in a film so it might be cool to get a film with a good one	i see kaafi interesting sound karta hai mujhe pasand hai dragons usually bad guys rahte hai movies me to kisi film agar wo acche hai to kaafi cool baat hai
and vikings as well it sounds like a very unique setting	aur vikings bhi hai kaafi unique setting hai
oh no but i guess hiccup finds out that not all dragons are bad in the end	oh nahi but i guess hiccup ko pata chalega sab dragons bure nahi hote
see hiccup is scrawny and cant fight because he is scrawny so he makes things apparatuses if you will	see hiccup bahut scrawny hai aur isliye fight nahi kar sakta to wo cheeze banata hai apparatus bol sakte ho

i see i bet he works together with his new dragon friend to help them out then	i see mai sart lagata hu ki wo apne naye gragon mitra ko madad karne ke liye milkar kam karenge
so hiccup and his friends decide they are going to help out hiccups friendly dragon and they all learn how to train awkward dragons and go off to fight the biggest dragon which they call red death	isliye hiccup aur uske friends ne decide kiya ki wo biggest dragon ki jisko red death kaha jata hai unse ladai ke liye wo hiccups friendly dragon ko madad karenge aur wo log sikhenge ki awkward dragons ko kaise train kiya jaye

that s good was the movie fast paced	accha hai kya movie fast paced thi
in most moments yes	jyadatar moments me haan
do you feel they relied too much on special effects though	kyu tumhe lagta hai wo special effects pe bahut jyada rely kiye
not it feels very real	nahi wo kaafi real lagta hai
who was your favorite character in the movie	movie me tumhara favorite character kaun tha
why is that	aisa kyu
he was a complex character not straight up good guy or bad guy	wo complex character tha bilkul good guy ya bad guy nahi tha
do you feel the movie had a fitting ending or was it a cliffhanger	tumhe kya lagta hai movie ki fitting ending thi ya cliffhanger thi
as an historical drama there was little chance for a cliffhanger so it ended well	kyuki wo historical drama hai usme thoda chance tha cliffhanger ka to wo acchi end hui
that s good do you feel that all the characters were well developed	accha kya tumhe lagta hai sabhi characters well developed the
no the gibson character could have been better developed	nahi gibson character thoda aur develop kiya jaa sakta tha
what about casting choices were the actors all pretty decent for their character roles	casting choices ke baare mein kya khayaal hai kya wo sab actors kafi decent they unke character roles ke liye
they were with some surprises like harry styles making the cast	han wo they saath mein harry styles jaise ka cast mein hona surprise tha
yes not only in the military side but also in regards to the characterization of civilian life	han na sirf military side par lekin civilian life ke characterization ke hisaab se bhi
what was your favorite part of the whole movie	tumhare liye movie ka sabse favorite part kya tha
the scene where tommy alex and gibson hide inside a trawler	wo scene jisme tommy alex aur gibson trawler ke andar hide karte hain
okay	acha
alex seems like a really cool character especially with all the realism described	alex kafi cool character lagta hai khaskar jis realism se usey describe kiya gaya hai
so yes i am interested	ha me interested hu
i wonder why there is a gap in the rotton tomatoes score and the metacritic score for wonder woman	i wonder rotten tomatoes score aur metacritic score me wonder woman k liye itna gap kyu hai
hello that is very strange maybe they have different audiences did you originally see this as a war movie i guess i personally separate war movies from super hero movies	hello ye kaafi strange hai maybe unki different audience hai kya tumne originally ise war movie type se dekha i guess personally main war movies aur super hero movies ko seperate karta hu
i was shocked though it was so well received with cirtics considering its a dc film haha usually marvel runs the place	haalaanki main hairaan tha ki yah ek dc movie haaha ko dekhate hue sirtiks ke saath bahut achchhee tarah se praapt hua tha aamataur par marvel jagah chalaata hai
thats true if they can keep the cast and crew together i think the chances of it being a hit increase i believe thats more then exchanges we ve had about the movie now	yah sach hai agar ve kalaakaaron aur chaalak dal ko ek saath rakh sakate hain to mujhe lagata hai ki yah ek hit virddhi kee sambhaavana hai mera maanana ​​hai ki se adhik eksachenjon ke baad ab hamane movie ke baare mein socha hai
the document just updated for me one of the things that caught my eye of the movie is how the time period was depicted especially with how princess diana received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfies it is an interesting disconnect	dastaavez sirph mere lie apadet kiya gaya movie kee meree nazar mein aane vaalee cheejon mein se ek yah hai ki samay avadhi ko kaise chitrit kiya gaya tha khaasakar princess diana ko photographic plet kaise milee jabaki ab ham selphee le sakate hain yah ek dilachasp disconnect hai
oh mine just updated too sorry about that i think thats interesting and a good period for the film i think the mythology involved behind it was very intriguing	oh mera bhee adyatan kiya gaya is baare mein kshama karen mujhe lagata hai ki movie kelie dilachasp aur ek achchhee avadhi hai mujhe lagata hai ki isake peechhe shaamil pauraanik katha bahut pecheeda thee
the way ares was punished was also interesting with only zeus able to wound him in the battle	jis tarah se eres ko dandit kiya gaya tha vah bhee dilachasp tha keval zeus ne use ladaee mein ghaayal karane mein saksham kiya
especially with the germans trying to engineer an even deadlier version of the chemical weapons they had i think that ties very well into everyone s ingrained mortality	vishesh roop se germans ke paas raasaayanik hathiyaaron ke ek bhee ghaatak sanskaran ko injeeniyar karane kee koshish kar raha tha mujhe lagata hai ki har kisee kee nirbaadh mrtyu dar mein bahut achchha sambandh ha
that is a really interesting point that i haven t considered i know that the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really solidifys that	yah vaastav mein ek dilachasp bindu hai jis par mainne vichaar nahin kiya hai mujhe pata hai ki philm ko vyaapak roop se naareevaad ko ek aavaaj dene ke lie ghoshit kiya gaya tha lekin yah bindu vaastav mein thos hai
i thought the scene when sir patrick revealed himself as ares also influenced that where he wanted to use the godkiller sword to destroy humanity but wonder woman said no	maine socha jis scene main sir patrick reveal kiya kyonki ares ne bi influence kiya tha jahan woh godkiller sword ko use karke humanity ko destroy karna chatha tha lekin wonder woman ne no kah diya
yeah i really didn t except wonder women to be the godkiller although it does make sense	yeah main really expect nahin kiya wonder woman hi godkiller thi although isme koi sense nahin hai
i think that was another big feminist point in the movie in my opinion the ending of the movie was very heartfelt and connected how wars of the past influence our present when princess diana emailed bruce wayne	i think woh ek bada feminist point hai movie hai mere opinion hai movie ka ending bahut heartfelt tha aur connect kiya ki kaise past wars hamare present ko influence karte hain princess diana ne email kiya bruce wayne ko
the casting helped make the movie incredible the charisma and chemistry between every character showed the scene where steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well i think	casting ne help kia movie ko incredible banane ke liye charisma aur chemistry ke andar character dikhta hai jo scene jahan steve ne bomber ko hijack kiya acchi tarah dikhta hai
steve has a really inteseting role in the movie too providing a lot of support but still not taking over the main role	steve ka bhi accha interesting role hai movie mein bahut support deta hai lekin phir bhi main role nahi leta
his character was an excellent supporting character in my opinion	uska charcter excellent supporting charcter hai mere khayal se

any elements of lgbt freedom in it because i realize most movies now a days potray lbgt freedom	kuch lgbt freedom hai isme kyon ki main realize kar raha hoon ki aaj kal lgbt freedom ko portray karte hain
oh thats good seems to be well made and researched	oh badhiya hai lagta hai accha banaya hai aur acchi research ki gayi hai
yes indeed they do but the positive aspect about the movie zootopia is that although it is all imaginary the film carries a message of acceptance that is thought provoking	haa woh karte hain lekin zootopia movie ki positive aspect hai ki although sab imaginary hai film ek acceptance message deti hai jo thought provoking hai

i have and i loved it how did you like it	ha maine dekha aur bahut pasand aya kya tumne like kiya
it was better than i was expecting looks like alot of people liked it rotten tomatoes gives it a score	baki sabse accha that lagta hai bahut logon ko pasand aya rotten tomatoes ne score diya hai
i think because it had something for everyone action and a beautiful woman for the guys and a strong female character for the gals	i think isme sabke liye kuch hai ladko ke liye action and beautiful woman aur ladkiyo ke liye strong female character
indeed plus it was the first time ever that a female director directed a comic book superhero movie	indeed saath main pahli baar koi female director directed a comic book superhero movie

hi today we ll be discussing batman vs superman	namaste aaj ham batman vs superman kee charcha karenge
great do i need to watch any other dc comic movies prior to watching this one	mahaan kya mujhe ise dekhane se pahale kisee any dc comik movies dekhane kee jaroorat hai
i can t honestly say however as a critic noted it s better than man of steel but not as good as the dark knight	mai sach nhi keh skta halaki ye man of steel se better hai lekin dark knight jitni achi nhi hai
who are the lead actors	lead actors kon hai
batman superman and even wonder woman makes an appearance	batman superman aur wonder woman bhi hai isme
haha do you know which actors play batman superman and wonder woman in this movie	haha kya aap jante ho ki is film mai konse actor batman superman aur wonder womanrole ker rhe hai
ben affleck plays batman bruce wayne henry cavill plays clark kent superman gal gadot stars in the film as well as diane lane as martha kent and amy adams as louis lane are you a fan of any of those actors	ben affleck batmanka bruce wayne henry cavill clark kent superman ka role paly ker rhe hai gal gadot film mai diane lane martha kent ka aur amy adams louis lane ka role play ker rhe hai kya tum in actors ke fan ho
all but ben affleck lest super hero movie i saw him in was daredevil and that was rough let s hope he s better in this	sabhi lekin ben affleck ki last super hero movie main usse daredevils mai dekh tha wo mote tha hoskta hai isme kuch acha kam hoga
though i am a michael keaton fan when it comes to batman i suspect anyone playing batman who is not keaton will be weird to me	halaki me batman mai michael keaton ka fan hu muje lgta hai ki koi or batman ka paly nhi ker payge jo michel keaton ne kiya
most of the critics wasn t too fond of it but cinemascore have it a rating of b which i feel is about right for this film	bhote se critics ko ye pasand nhi tha par cinemascore mai rating b thi muje lgta hai ye sahi thi
i have and would grade it a solid b just as cinemascore did are you a fan of director zack snyder	maine is solid b grade karta jaise k cinemascore ne kiya kya tum director zack snyder k fan ho
he directed batman vs superman the film takes place months after the battle between general zod and superman superman becomes a controversial figure while clark kent learns of batman s form of justice and seeks to expose him via daily planet articles	usne batman v superman direct ki hai wo movie general zod aur superman k battle k month baad hoti hai superman ek controversial figure ban jata hai aur clark kent ko batman k justice k tareeke k baare me pata chalta hai aur wo use daily planet k articles me expose karna chahta hai
i can t honestly say i know he directed this film while david s goyer and chris terrio cowrote it	honestly main bol nahi sakta hai mujhe pata hai k usne ye film direct ki hai aur david s goyer aur chris terrio ne write ki hai
they are lex luthor who is obsessed with defeating superman basically manipulates them into fighting each other	wo hai lex luthor jo superman ko harane ko lekar obsessed hai basically dono ko ek dusre ko fight karne me manipulate kar deta hai
whose side is wonder woman on	wonder woman kis side pe rahti hai
well to be honest batman has superman beat and just before he can kill superman superman utters save martha to which lane enterenters and explains martha is his mother batman rescues martha while superman confronts luther on the scout ship at this point wonder woman hasn t debuted yet	well to be honest batman superman ko hara deta hai aur jaise hi wo superman ko maarne wala rahta hai superman bolta hai save martha to lane andar aati hai aur explain karti hai k martha uski maa hai batman martha ko rescue karta hai aur superman scout ship pe luthor ko confront karta hai is point pe wonder woman ab tak debut nahi ki hai
dang crazy that batman has superman beat isn t batman just a millionaire with a lot of fancy gadgets superman at least has real super powers you would think that would give him a one up did batman have kryptonite or something	dang crazy batman superman ko hara deta hai kya wo bas ek millionaire nahi juske pas bhut fancy gadget hai superman k paas at least real super powers hai koi bhi sochega k wo superman jeetega kya batman k paas kryptonite ya kuch tha
they	वे
they do thankfully batman actually saves martha while superman travels to the scout ship to confront luther	ve shukr manaate hain baitamain vaastav mein maartha ko bachaata hai jabaki suparamain ka saamana loothar ke saath skaut jahaaj tak jaata hai
luther was also the one who kidnapped martha he doesn t kill luther but luther is arrested to which batman confronts him while he s in prison warning that he ll always be watching	luther bhee vahee tha jisane maartha ka apaharan kiya tha vah loothar ko nahin maarata hai lekin loothar ko giraphtaar kar liya jaata hai jisamen baitamain ne jel mein rahane ke dauraan usaka saamana kiya chetaavanee dee ki vah hamesha dekhata rahega
so basically leaving an opening for another movie in the franchise	to mool roop se phrainchaizee mein ek aur philm ke lie ek opaning chhod raha hoon
i ve heard debates on superman s and batman s outfits in this movie some say that they are awesome and some say that they are ridiculous and too different form their b eloved originals what are your thoughts on this	mainne is philm mein suparamain aur baitamain ke aautaphit par bahas sunee hai kuchh ka kahana hai ki ve kamaal ke hain aur kuchh kahate hain ki ve haasyaaspad hain aur bahut alag roop mein unake b ailovaid mool hain is par aapake vichaar kya hain
they do sadly superman dies however bruce wayne intends to form a team of metahumans starting with the metahumans he found in luthor s files to protect the world in sueprmans absence	ve karate hain aphasos kee baat hai ki suparamain kee mrtyu ho jaatee hai haalaanki broos ven ne metaahumans kee ek teem banaane ka iraada kiya metahumans ke saath shuroo karate hue unhonne lyoopor kee phailon mein sooparamain kee anupasthiti mein duniya kee raksha karane ke lie paaya
while it did seem like minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together i still found it better than man of steel	jabaki yah aisa lagata tha jaise ek bade aadamee ka do minat mein ek saath do gudiyon ko pakadana mujhe abhee bhee main oph steel se behatar laga
wait superman dies how	rukoo superman maar gaya keise
well to be honest at the end of the film the dirt atop sueprman s coffin does begin to levitate i think we re at the finish line i enjoyed chatting with you about batman vs superman i highly recommend you seeing it one day if you agree with cinemascore they rated it a b so i think you ll enjoy it and encourage you to watch it take care and have a great day	bahut imandaari se film ke aakhir mei dirt superman kocoffin mei rakh deta hai socho ki ham aakhari line mei hai hamare saath batman or superman ke bare mei baat karne ko maja le mei aapko ek din isko dekhane ki salah deta hu yadi aap sahmat hai to filma ka score b hai mere khayal de aap pasand karoge aap apna khayal rakhe or aapka din achcha ho

so if i like war movies it sounds like this one has a lot of action and good acting i would like it	tho agar muje war movies pasand hein tho uska sounds tho kuch aisa rehana chavunga ki kaafi action aur good acting tho muje pasand aayega
maybe it s also very artsy something critics like if you like going to museums and looking at meaningless stuff then maybe if not stay home	ho saktha yeh thoda artsy lagtha hein agar aap museums jaana pasand karenge tho is stuff meaningless hoga agar nahi tho ghar mein hi baitna
how are impressionist paintings pretentious	kaise impressionist paintings pretentious ban jaathe hein
that is my impression	wo mera impression hai
it s not long though minutes	wo itni lambi nahi hai minutes ki hai
ok that is pretty short for a war movie	ok war movie k liye kafi short hai
no one famous in it fionn whoitehead never heard of him bbefore jack lowden	usme koi famous nahi hai fionn whitehead uske baare me kabhi nahi suna jack lowden
great reviews from critics but critics like artsy stuff they were deeply moved	critics ne badhiya review diya hai but critics ko artsy stuff pasand ata hai kafi move hogaye the wo log
how was the soundtrack	soundtrack kaisa tha
i don t recall there was a lot of sound but mostly of war if you see it go to a cinema with a great sound system	mei yaad nahi kar pa rahi hui vaha bahut jayada aawaj thi par jayada yudha ki thi yadi aap dekhana chahate ho to bahut achcha sound system ke sath jao
do you remember who directed it	tumko yah yaad hai ki kisne isko direct kiya tha
you definitely need surround sound	tumko surround sound ki bahut jayada jarurat hai
chirstopher nolan directed is he any good	chistopher nolan ne isko nirdeshit kiya hai kya vah achcha hai
it s set in france wwii it s about the british army churchill makes an appearance	vah france mei set ho gaya hai wwii yah british sena ke bare mei hai churchil ne apni upasthiti darj karai hai
helllo lets talk about the great gatsby edition	hello great gatsby ke baare mein baat kar sakthe
hello can you tell me the plot	hello plot ke baare mein kuch bol sakthe
its based upon the novel by f scott fitzgerald	yeh ka noves based hein jo f scott fitzgerald ne likha hein
who plays gatsby	kon khel raha hai gatsby
leonardo dicaprio playes gatsby	leonardo dicaprio khel raha hai gatsby
i like him who plays daisy	mai pasad karta hi usse kon khel raha hai daisy
it was carey mulligan	eha tha carey mulligan
what would you rate the movie	kyy ank doge iss cinema par
i would say its a less conventional theatrical celebration of the emotional and material extravagance that fitzgerald surveyed with fascinated abivalence	mai kahunga thora samagric rajnatic or vabuk natya samaroh jo ki mohik akarsan hai
should i watch it	kyy mai ese dekh sakta hu
i don t know but did you know tobey maguire who played nick carraway was also the narrator of the movie	mai nai janta par mai etna janta hu maguire eska avinata or nick carraway vi katha wachak hai
i did not know that	mai itna nahi janta hu
do you like other movies with leonardo dicaprio in it mabee if you do you will like this one	kayy tum pasand karte ho cinema jisme leonardo dicaprio hai agar ha mai vi pasand karta hu
it gets a cinema score of b and gives a good picture of the roaring twenties in new york state	cinema score tho b diya aur newyork state ka ache picture tho roaring twenties hein
you know i dont know how similar to the book it is i never read it but perhaps you could find that info online	aapko patha hein ki muje patha hi nahi ki itna similar is book ka hein jo kabhi read hi nahi kiya aur online mein bhi kuch info nahi mila
if you do watch the movie i found the stand out actor is joel edgerton as he was very good and showing the grufness of the character he played joel edgerton	agar aap ko is movie ko dekhna tho mein joel edgerton ko stand out kahunga kyon ki voh ache hein aur unka grufness charcter tho badiya hein jo joel edgerton ka play kiye hein
and he really does a great job despite the one dimensionality given to his role	vaakahi mein voh ache kaam karthe despite unka yek dimensionality role deya gaya hein
he s a great actor	badiya actor hein vo
and he thought it was daisy calling him but never got the chance to find out because george shot him then commited suicide and the media planted gatsby as myrtles lover and killer	aur voh soch raha tha ki daisy usse bulayagi lekin usse patha hi nahi chala kyonki geroge ne usse suicide attempt karne ko kaha aur media gatsby ko planted kiya aur myrtles ka lover ko aur maara
that is sad	sad hein yar
mabee the sadness of the whole movie is what caused the metaccritic score to only be	maybe is whole movie sadness ka hein tho kis jis ke liye metacritic ka score huva
that s true i ll look through them before i watch it	sach hein yar muje lagtha hien ki mein neih isse pehele bhi dekha hoon
the scene where nick finishes typing his memoir and titles it the great gatsby after his final walkthrew of gatsby s mansion i really liked and disliked as it brings a sense of the emptiness we all leave behind when we pass on	is scene jaha nick memoir ko typing finishes kiya aur titles tho badiya gatsby jab walkthrew ko final gatsby ka mansion gaya muje really acha laga lekin us scene ka emptiness ko pasand nahi hein

giant man eating shark attacking people makes for an entertaining watch	shaark par hamala karane vaala vishaalakaay aadamee ek manoranjak ghadee ke lie banaata hai
not much of a talker huh	jyaada baat karane vaala huh nahin
probably wouldn t be good for kids though	shaayad bachchon ke lie achchha nahin hoga
that depends	vah nirbhar karata hai
of course the woman who is skinny dipping get s snagged first	beshak jo mahila patala hai vah pahale soonghatee hai
closing the beaches knee jerk reaction but probably a good idea	samudr taton ko band karana ghutane ka jhataka pratikriya lekin shaayad ek achchha vichaar hai
and of course they get greedy and want to pretend its a boating accident and not a shark attack	aur nishchit roop se ve laalachee ho jaate hain aur apanee nauka vihaar durghatana ka naatak karana chaahate hain na ki shaark ke hamale ka

typically no since i generally like to watch anime but if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid then i usually will make a effort to see it	zyadatar nhi main aamtaur par anime movies dekhta huin lekin jab main bacha tha to ek hi franchise dwara banayi gayi movies dekhta tha to main aamtaur par aisi movies dekhne ki koshish krta huin
and i agree those scores kinda seem rather low	aur main maanata hoon ki voh score thode kam lag rahe hain
makes sense i typically only pay attention to the ratings when it s a director who i am familiar with if i know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings i usually will wait to hear from friends family before paying to see it	samajh mein aata hai main jayadatar tab ratings pe dhayan deta huin jab main director ko janta huin agar mujhe pata hai ki aamtaur par unka kam bahut shaandaar hai or uss ek movie ke bahut buri ratings main aamtaur par uspe paise lagane se pehle friends family se sunn leta huin
also im a fan of comedy movies so i ll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes	saath hi mein mujhe comedy movies bhi pasand hai to main shayad memes or jokes enjoy karunga
comedy movies are always a must see in my book	comedy movies meri book me must see hain
and if im being honest pixar usually makes good movies so i have good expectations illumination movies is what im iffy about	aur sach bolun to pixar hamesha achi movies banati hai to mujhe achi expectations hain illumination movies keliye main thoda iffy hun
mike is what in the i never knew that	mike hai kya mujhe ye bilkul nahi pata tha
ya that name is great	han wo name bhadiya hai
he s only seven when he goes on the field trip he goes to college eleven years later so he d be eighteen	wo sirf seven tha jab wo field trip pe jata hai wo gyarah saal bad college ko jata ha to wo ab attharah ka hoga
i misread that at first too	maine bhi ye pehle misread kiya
ahhh i see well that clears that up	ahhh mujhe lagta hai ye sab clear kar deta hai
looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities	lagta hai ye movie kafi heavily cartoon fraternities par based hai
yep	yep
oozma kappa i can t believe they threw a kappa meme in there	oozma kappa muje nahi lagtha koi kappa ka meme banega
every movie with a fraternity sorority always contains kappa ever notice that	har movie mein kappa ka fraternity sorority banaya kya aap notice nahi kiya
wonder what cda stands for in this movie clearly it s some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have	cda tho is movie ke liye stands kiye clearly kuch enforcer form kare aur monster ke paas kis taray ka enforcer hein
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough	yeh kuch scary ke tarh bhi ho sakthe
nope i thought the same i think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph	nahi muje bhi aise hi kuch lagtha kyon ki is mein kuch gender context nahi hein
well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids	tho yeh kids ke liye tho safe movie hein
no i don t think it s to make sure they re scary enough the cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university	nahi muje nahi lagtha yeh itna bhi scary hoga cda ne cop ko form kiya aur usse campus se expulsion karne ke liye university aathe
although i expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there	thoda hidden adult jokes hein us college aur fraternity ne tho yek ya do slip jarur liya hoga
ah i see that would make sense	ah ab hui na baath
true movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them	sach in dinno mein movies tho itna formulaic tropes hein jo kids ko nahi dekha sakthe
i hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable	movies tho fresh aur unpredictable honna mera hope hein
keep the kids on their toes	kids ko tho hum hamare toes mein rakhna chahiye
one can only hope	har kisi ka hope hein
and still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it	smart bhi rehena chahiye jo parents bhi enjoy kar sakthe
a on a kids movie doesn t seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes	kids movie tho bad hi hota mera opinion se keyscenes ko badne ke baath
thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good and still seem better than movies today	isliye pixar ka purane films acha rahate mera khayal se aur aaj bhi is movies better hey
thats true i think overall it sounds like a good movie	yeh tho sach hein overall yeh kuch ache movie sounds kartha
hi do you think this movie deserved a rotten tomatoes score that seems awfully high	hi kya rotten tomatoes diya jo deserved hei voh tho awfully high hei yar
it s hard to say they are usually my go to website for reviews but its rare you see a score in the area	usually voh reviews ke liye website jaathe lekin rare se unko area ko dekhne pe lethe
and it seems the critics had alot to say on this film as well	aur critics tho is film ke liye kaafi kuch kehane ko he
that is quite the compliment indeed i have yet to see the it but i definitely plan too are you a fan of drama films	voh thoda compliment hein indeed muje dekhna pasand hein mein jarur plan karungi aap drama films ka fan ho
the acting by michael shannon and octavia spencer was impressive	michael shannon aur octavia spencer ka acting tho impressive hein

good how about you	good aur tum kaise ho
no i haven t is it good	no mene nahi dekhi kya voh good he
what about la la land have you seen that	what about la la land kya tumne vah dekha he
i haven t seen la la land either which one would you recommend	mene bhi la la land nahi dekha he tum konsa recommend karoge
yes they kill the shark and get to relax and be happy in the end	ha ve shark ko kill karte he end me relax aur happy rahne ke liye
honestly i would recommend jaws it s such a great classic movie	eemaanadaaree se main jabade kee siphaarish karoonga yah itanee behatareen klaasik philm hai
why not la la land do you not like it	kyon nahin la la laind kya aapako yah pasand nahin hai
la la land is ok but it doesn t compare to the action of jews i give it a whereas jaws is a	la la bhoomi theek hai lekin yah yahoodiyon kee kaarravaee kee tulana nahin karata hai main ise deta hoon jabaki jabade hai
la la land is a musical romantic comedy	la la bhoomi ek sangeetamay romaantik komedee hai
hmm you might have to convince me a little more about jaws just because i already know the ending since you said la la land is a romantic comedy is there any romance in jaws	hamm tum mujhe jabade ke baare mein thoda aur samajhaane ke lie ho sakata hai kyonki main pahale se hee ant jaanata hoon jab se aapane kaha tha ki la la laind ek romaantik komedee hai kya joz mein koee romaans hai
and is la la land based on a real story	aur kya la la laind ek vaastavik kahaanee par aadhaarit hai
no jaws has little romance	nahin jabade mein thoda romaans hai

so carreys character bruce nolan is a reporter hardworking but not very successful he has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over him	tho carreys ka character bruce nolan hein jo reporter hein hardworking lekin successful nahi hein uska bad luck bahut hein tho voh limit mein nahi reach hota jab us coworker neih promotion ke liye gaya tho
he then starts his complaints to god who ends up responding with the proposition that gives him his powers	tho voh god ke paas chala jatha aur kaafi complaints kartha aur usko proposition ka power mil jaatha

yeah i think so but dicaprio is not for comedy movie in my opinion	ha me socha hu mere opinion me dicaprio comedy movie nahi he
was the movie very funny	movie bahut funny tha
i wasn t sure what the genre black comedy referred to	me pakka nahi tha genre black comedy referred tha
there are some scene that it is funny example is when dicaprio is scamming other people	waha kuch scene the jo funny the je se ki jab dicaprio dusre logo ko scamming kar raha tha
so it took place in the past	to wah past me hua tha ninteen eighteen seven

hi there	hi there
hello have you seen monsters university	hello kya aapne monsters university dekhi hai
hi	hi
this movie is about how facebook got started by mark zuckerberg it s called the social network interesting to watch because it s based on real events	mark zuckerburg ne facebook kaise start kiya movie is baare me hai iska naam hai the social network dekhne me bahut interesting hai kyonki ye real events pe based hai
i have heard of that movie before	maine is movie ke baare me pahle bhi suna hai
although i haven t watched it before	although maine pahle dekhi nahi hai
it was more popular than the book it was based on the accidental billionaires probably because it s a tale of sex money and betrayal stuff we can all identify with	yah jis kitab par yah aadharit hai usse bhi jyada popular hai the accidental billionaires probably because ye kahani hai sex money aur dhokhe ki wo stuff jiske sath ham sab identify karte hai
oh that is really interesting	oh yah to really interesting hai
it makes it sound more intriguing than before	yah to pahle se jyada intriguing sound kar raha hai
yes we ve all heard of facebook but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising i didn t believe everything i saw in the movie but it held my interest	yes ham sabne facebook ke bare me suna hai but ye shuru kaise hua uski story kafi surprising hai movie me jo dekha us sab par believe to nahi hua par mera interest isme bana raha
i think sometimes they add information to movies just to keep the audience entertained	i think sometime ye movie me kuch information sirf ise interesting aur audience ko entertained rakhne ke liye karte hai
no doubt it is a drama zuckerberg and the current staff weren t involved in making the movie it has a kind of dark irony but one of the founders eduardo saverin was consulted by the book s author	beshak ye drama hai zuckerberg aur current staff ka koi involvement nahi tha movie banane isme kuch dark irony hai lekin ek founder eduardo saverin ne book ke author se mulaqat ki
so would you recommend seeing this movie it a couple of years old if not older	toh kya aap ye movie dekhna recommend karte hai ye kuch saal puraani hai agar aur zyada puranni nahi hai toh
the film starts in when zuckerberg was a year old student at harvard he actually created a campus website called facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students	film shuru hoti hai mein jub zuckerberg saal ka student tha harvard mein usne asal facemash naam ki campus website banayi jisme users female students ke photos ke attractiveness ko rate kar sakte thay
oh that s just the beginning that website was so popular it got the attention of the winklevoss twins who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to harvard so the origins of the idea for the site are kind of vague	oh wo toh bus shuruat hai wo website itni popular hai ke isko winklevoss twins ka attention mila jo upper class men thay jinho ne harvard ke liye exclusive dating website banayi
as a programmer i could see the damage that can be done by hacking into databases and networks	as a programmer me ye dekh sakta hun ki databases aur networks me hacking se jo nuksaan ho sakta hai
damage was bound to happen in this situation	damage is situation me hone ke liye bounded tha
so you also know that programming knowledge doesn t necessarily translate to business smarts it s when zuckerberg gets hooked up with napster co founder sean parker that the business really starts to take off	so tum bhi ye jaante ho ki business ko smart translate karne ke liye programming ka knowledge necessary nahi hai ye jab zukerberg ne napster ke co founder sean parker se hooked up kiya is se business really me take off karna start karta hai
i had totally forgotten about using napster i use to always use it had no idea he co f ounded it	me npaster ko use karne ke baare me totally bhool gaya tha me use hamesa use karne ka aadi hun mujhe koi idea nahi ki wo iska co founder hai
there were other social networks before the facebook too which is what zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to yale columbia and stanford i liked napster too and had a myspace account but that all changed after parker suggested they drop the and move facebook to palo alto	facebook ke pehle bhi other social networks the jo ki zuckerberg ne kaha tha jab wo site ko yale columbia aur stanford me expand kar rahe the mujhe nepster bhi pasand hai aur mera myspace ka account bhi hai but ye sab badal gaya jab parker ne suggest kiya facebook to palo alto
i i also had a myspace account but haven t logged in roughly years	mere pass bhi myspace account hai par maine kabhi hi years me logged in kiya
been a while for me too parker ended up sharing a house in palo alto with zuckerberg leaving his partner saverin in new york to work on business development meanwhile they were developing plans for the business in california to make a billion dollar company	mere liye thodi der ho gayi paker ne zuckerberg ke saath house sharing khatm kar di palo alto me apne partner saverin ko new york me hi business development ka kaam karne ke liye chhod diya meanwhile wo california me billion dollar ki company ke business plan ko develop karne lage
well saverin and the winklevoss twins tried to keep their interests in the company the film is intercut with scenes from their depositions in the cases against zuckerberg they eventually settled out of court because zuckerberg s defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury	well saverin aur winklevoss judwa ne apan interests company me rakhne ka try kiya film me un scenes ko intercut kar diya jisme zuckerberg ke against deposition case the unhone eventually court ke bahar hi settle kar liya zukerberg ke defense sochte hai ki wo jury ko unsympathetic appear hoge
well if he wasn t going to seem unsympathetic than maybe it was the best choice for the defense	tho agar voh unsympathetic ke liye nahi jaayega tho defense he uska best choice rehega
no doubt the film has lots of sordid details about the founding and the callous attitude zuckerberg had towards his collaborators but the end when he s sending a friend request is when it get s really weird	no doubt film mein tho kahi sordid details hein us founding aur callous ka attitude ke baare mein zuckerberg tho us collaborators ke sa saath hein lekin end mein jab usne usko friend ko request diya tho thoda weird feel huva
ugh i hate endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events	ugh mein end hate kartha kyon ki voh cliff hangers ko nahi choda aur end mein kuch explanation bhi nahi diya us future events ko
thanks	thanks
hello	hello
hello so the movie we will be talking about is batman v superman	hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai batman v superman
great i haven t actually seen that yet but have been really wanting to which actors play batman and superman	great maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai but sahi me dekhna chahta hu batman aur superman kaun actors bane hai
the actors are really great and you probably know all of them ben affleck henry cavill amy adams and jesse eisenberg to name a few	actors sahi me acche hai aur tum probably sabhi ko jaante ho unme se kuch ben affleck henry cavill amy adams and jesse eisenberg hai
oh that is a great cast henry cavill played superman in the latest superman film right	oh ye to badhiya cast hai henry cavill ne latest superman film me superman play kiya tha na
sorry a great cast	sorry badhiya cast hai
ooh that is excellent i am looking forward to seeing wonder woman are batman and superman enemies at the start of the film	oooh ye to excellent hai mujhe wonder woman dekhni hai kya film k start me batman aur superman dushman hai
well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman	well lex batman ko superman se ladne me manipulate kar deta hai because wo superman ko clone kar ke liye obssessed hai
oh so batman is supposed to bring superman to lex luthor	oh to batman superman ko lex luthor k paas leke jata hai
no that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping by the way did i mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together	nahi waise nahi hota hai but wo use help karne me manipulate ho jata hai by the way kya maine mention kiya ye pahli movie hai jisme batman aur superman saath me hai
really the first time that seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long very cool is the story set in metropolis or gotham	really pahli baar ye jaante huye ke dono character itne time se hai ye cheez to bahut amazing hai bahut cool story metropolis me set hai k gotham me
the film appears to take place in both cities and batman comes to view superman as a threat to humanity	aisa lagta hai k film dono cities me hoti hai aur batman ko lagta hai k superman humanity k liye ek threat hai
that is interesting to have the film set in both cities so batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take superman down	yeh tho interesting hei yar is film tho dono cities ke hein tho batman ko aasan padega us superman ka duty karne mein
well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because clark kent a k a superman learns of batman s justice methods and tries to expose him all this happening while lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator	tho is characters ka relationships tho bada complex hein yar kyon ki clark kent ke vaje superman tho batmans ka justice method learn kiya aur usse expose bhi kiya tho lex luthor ne kryptonite ko approval kiya us senator se
interesting and so i imagine lois lane is in this story if so does she serve a greater purpose does she know both superheroes	interesting yar mein ab is story ko imagine ki tho uska greater purpose kya hein kya voh dono superheroes ko jaanthi hein
not usually i like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not i watch in theatres i have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed	nahi yar mein apne aap judge kartha lekin kuch reviews tho overwhelmingly acha ya bura hota jo muje theathres mein movie dekhte samai relate kartha hoon muje lagtha hein ki is movies ka reviews thoda mixed hein
cool i guess that s one of the ultimate questions which one could beat out the other do they team up at all in the film	cool tho konsa yeh beat karega kya yeh film teamup hoga
oh wow the pairing of batman and superman s mom is a really cool part of the story heartwarming	oh wow batman aur superman ke mom ki pairing really sabse cool part tha story ka heartwarming
i know but the film ends with sadly the death of superman	i know but sadly fim ka end superman ki death ke sath hota hai
oh wow i am surprised by that i thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two	oh wow mujhe surprise hua isse i thought wo log apni story line ko aage badhne denge aage ki ek do aur movie ke liye
dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the director	don t worry coffin ke upar ki dhool ko hilte hue dikhaya director ne kisi badhiya wink ki tarah
haha that s the closing shot	haha wo to closing shot tha
i believe so it is in the last scene	i believe so ye last scene me ha na
awesome take care	awesome take care
hello do you like superhero movies	hello kya tumhe superhero movies pasand hai
i usually do but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not	usually haan but rating se ye determine nahi hota k main movie dekhunga ya nahi
the film has several great big name actors which is another reason i like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone	is film me bahut bade bade actors bhi hai jo ki ek aur reason hai aur actors dekh ke hi movie dekh lege
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest along with super heros and villans a good rating does help me feel like i will not waste my time watching something awful	badhiya actors ka saath me badi screen me hone ka potential me definitely mera interest superheros aur villains k sath hi ek good rating se mujhe ye feel karne me asani hoti hai k kuch bekaar dekh k apna time waste nahi karra hai
but the same time will not deter me from a film if i am just into the genre	but at the same time wo mujhe movie dekhne se rok nahi sakta jiske genre me main bahut interested hu
the on rotten tomatoes seems more accurate	rotten tomatoes ne ne diya jo accurate hein
what did you think of the bat scene in the movie	tho aapko is movie mein bat scene ke baare mein kya sochthe
batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out	batman bachon ko ache film hein kyon ki unhe life ka startup milega
because this movie is called batman begins i agree that it was appropriate to show bruce s beginnings	are is movie ko batman begins ka naam diya hein lekin muje lagtha isko bruce ka beginning dena chahiye
unlikely yes i think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to the bats	shayad han mujhe lagta hai ki wo log batman kaise bana uski mysterious shuruvat batane ja rahe the par thodi mystery choodna chahta hu kyuki use abhi bhi bats se phobia ho jata hai
very ironic mr chill is more of a bone chilling murderer	bahut ironic hai mr chill bone chilling murderer hai
he is also murdered too so at least he gets what he deserves	isne bhi khun kiya hai so jo woh deserve karta hai usko mil gaya
he got whats coming to him but bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge	usko pata chal gaya tha uske sath kya hone wala hai par bruce uska khun nahi karega isiliye muje lagta hai ki usme revenge ki bhavna rahegi
injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder in any case	kisi bhi case me khun ka karan anyay nahi bataya ja sakta
i feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows and to purge his fear of bats this key part i think is pretty lucky break for him as he is doing jail time in a foreign country	woh lucky hai ki woh league of shadows ka part bana hai aur usne apne bats ke dar ko bhaga diya hai mujhe lagta hai ki yah important part uske liye lucky break sabit hoga kyuki woh foreign country ke jail me hai
it is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing	yah bilkul ajeeb baat hai ki iski family naukar afford kar shakti hai fir bhi wah jail me chori karne jata hai
i really like gary oldman as gordon he plays a good cop really well	gordon ke kirdar me mujhe gary oldman bahut accha lagta hai wah achhe police wale ka kirdar acchi tarah nibhata hai
what did you think of the scarecrow scenes	scarecow scenes ke bare me aapke kya vichar hain
the scarecrow was particularly scary character trying to poison the water supply	scarecrow tho badi scary character hein voh tho water supply ko poison kar raha tha
and batman was poisoned with the fear inducing drugs i thought it was over for him	aur batman bhi poisioned huva us fear inducing drugs se mein tho uska jaan khatre mein hein
it appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points yeah	uska character tho over ho chuka tha kahi movie mein
he seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences	yeh tho otherworldy power ka surviving tho uska past experiences hein
hello	hello
hello	hello
lets talk about a movie from steven spielberg d	chalo movie ki baat krte he steven spielberg ki d
yes	yes
sometimes spielberg makes these movies that are not very adventure related i love spielbergs work if theyre going to be adventure movies	kabhi kabhi spielberg ke movie utne adventure related nahin hote mujhe spielbergs ki work pasand hai agar woh adventure movies hon toh
haha after reading this though i m interested in seeing it	haha ise padhkar main intersted hoon
lets see now	dekhte hain now
i mean i do like those types of movies but when it comes to spielberg you got to bring in the adventure	mera matlab hai ki mujhe waise type ke movies pasand hai lekin jab spielberg ki baat ati hai toh usme adventure hona chahiye
anyways yeah	jaise bhi yeah
this seem to be a very interesting movie to say the least	lagta hai ye bahut interesting movie hai
haha i see he is a very versatile director though	haha mujhe lagta hai ki voh ek bahut versatile director hai
it does great cast behind it too	uske peeche bhi great cast hai
well of course hahaha	bilkul hahaha
i have too	mere paas bhi
the ratings for the movie seem appropriate for a spielberg movie	spielberg movie ke liye yah rating appropriate lagta hai
and how the soldiers were treated back home was terrible	aur soldiers ko back home kaise terribly treat kiya gaya tha
they do	usne kiya
very terrible	bahut terrible hai
i am not a fan of meryl streep though	mei meryl streep ka fannahi hui
one of the greatest but just too perfect for me lol	vo unme se ek mahan hai par vo mere liye perfect hai lol
yes	haa

but she is heavily praised	but usne bahut jayadi kimat chukaya
yeah but when it comes to oscars she is always there you can always see her old woman give space to the youngins hahahaha	haa mei oscars ke liye aai hui vo hamesha yaha rahati hai tum usko hamesha dekha sakte ho old woman youngins ko space dedo hahaha
haha she s a legend	hahaha vo legend hai
that s what they say	wo bhi yahi bolte hain

it s a film that is an american teen comedy film written by tina fey	wo ek american teen comedy film hai jise tina fey ne write kiya hai
do you know the rating of the movie	tumhe us movie ki rating pata hai
so it was received pretty well	to kaafi well received movie hai
i guess it depends on your style of parenting and how old they are the movie does have sexual references and i think cursing	i guess wo tumhari parenting style pe depend karta hai aur ispe k wo kitne bade hai movie me sexual referencec aur mujhe lagta hai ki cursing bhi hai
but that s to be expected in a teen comedy film	but teen comedy film me itna to expected hi hai
it was praised as being comic gold	usko comic gold bolke praise kiya gaya tha
that sounds pretty good do you know if tina fey has written any other movies	acha woh kaafi accha hai tujhe pata hai kya tina feyne koi doosri movies likhi hai kya
the movie is pretty long but just a normal length	movie toh lambi hai but normal lenght ki hai
john wick is a good action movie do you agree	john wich ek atcha action film hain kya aap sahamat hain

there were some russian mobsters in the movie	film mein kuch roosee dakait the
he came out of retirement when his wife got killed	weh retirement se tab bahar aaye jab unki wife marr chuki thi
yes	han
the critics gave it a score that s pretty good for an action movie	critics ne use ka score diya yeh bahut achha hai ek action movie ke liye
that was rotten tomatoes metacritic gave it a	weh rotten tomatoes tha metacritic ne diye
yeah i saw that	han maine dekha tha
i watched movies with better score	maine better score wali movies dekhta huin
it said his wife died but gave him the puppy so his vengeance was for the theft of his car and the death of his puppy	yeh kaha gya ki uski wife marr gayi but usne use puppy diya to uska badla uski chori hui car or puppy ki maut se liya gya
yeah but it was not a logical story	han but ye ek logical story nhi thi
nobody have a vengeance for their puppy got killed	kisi ne bhi puppy ke maare jane ka badla nhi liya
it is what they call neo noir i guess that means it is not supposed to make sense because it is an altered reality	ise voh neo noir call karte he mujhe lagta he that means iska koi sense nahi he because ye ek altered reality he
yes i watched the whole movie	yes mene whole movie dekhi
i watched some scenes	mene kuch scene watch kiye
the idea was that he was a hit man who retired so he could hand out with his wife	idea ye tha ki voh ek hit man tha jo retire ho gaya tha taki voh apni wife se hand out kar sake
but now whole movie	lekin ab whole movie
oh that s nice	oh ye nice he
sorry hang out	maph karna hang out
a retired hit man	ek retired hit man
so his wife got the puppy and then she died of natural causes or di sease or something	to usakee wife ko puppy mil gaya aur phir vah natural causes se ya disease se ya something else se mar gaya
so that s movie with lots of action	to is movie me lots of action he
oh that s too bad	arae wah toh bahut bura hai
so he find he whoever did that	toa wah dhoond lega wuh kisne kiya hai
she got him the puppy then after she died they killed his puppy and stole his car	usne uske liye ek pilla laaya uske baad jab wuh mur gayee unhone uska pilla maar diya aur uski car chori kar lee
yes that s what the movie is about the russian mobster s son did it	ji haan yeh movie usee ke baare mein hai ek roosi mobster ke bete ne kee
so what will happen in climax	toa climax mein kya hoga
so he just went to kill that guy and in order to do it he had to go through a lot of russian mobsters	toa wah usko maatne ke liye gaya jiske liye usae bahut se roosi mobsters se guzarna pada
sorry i didn t watch the whole film	maaf karein main ne wah film poori nahin dekhi
at the end he was able to go to iosef s safe house and kill him	aakhir kaar wuh losef ke surakshit ghar jaa paaya aur usae maar diya
oh interesting	arae rochak
k bro lets finish the chat	acha bai baat ko khatam karte hai
